It has been a negative life for me that's reduced my parting, my, my, my studies, everything about me. So it has been a difficult life life for me. Going to parties. I'm going to school too. I have stopped schools and I have been taking care of my mother. I have stopped school. There is no positive moment. In financial aspects, I don't have any money to take care of her again.

Describe, OK, giving assisting you about well-being the past few weeks. Regarding your relationship with family, friends, or comics to the Internet, changes or shifts. Relationships. The question too I have not. I have not noticed any changes. It has been the way I have been given my life for the past five years. Yep. My family and friends have run away because I'm taking care of my mother. So I'm I'm the only one with her now. No, no, no, no. Sorry, I can't hear you. No, it doesn't affect me. Oh. My communication, my communication and my attention has been shot with my family and friends. My colleagues in the world in the school too. I invite only one of my friends has told by me for the past four years. Five years. So even if I should call her, call her, she will take like two to three days before she come to me. Yes, yes. I can't hear you please. Please repeat. I can't hear you. Yes. Sorry, question 3, right? My family, I I told you the other time. But my family and friends are no more. They have. They have gone. They left me alone. It's only one of my friends that stay with me. Whenever I call her. She used to take three to four days to come. OK. Over the past few weeks, have you and the kids are not engineers intention making process. You. Yes please. My decision making has changed. Due to the food I eat at home. Financial everything. Because of the of my mother's sickness. Yes, yes, I do think about her. I have to put her into consideration first. Number four question, describe your self-care practices in the past few weeks to manage the daily stresses of caregiving, share your strategy strategies that have been particularly helpful in coping with the steady stress of caregiving. OK, #1. The time I cook for her. Time I do, I do take care of her. Time of caring, time of management. Time of making her happy. That's OK, then that's what I can say for that number four question please. I go on social media. Will I surf the Internet? To rest, I used to rest. Whenever I take care of us and I. Whenever she is asleep, I used to sleep too. I used to take a rest. My make sure I wake up before. I used to sleep very well before and go out, go to schools, go to clubs. I used to party very well, but now I don't used to do that again. I used to drive I I will put on a car and drive out wherever, whenever, wherever I'm going. Sorry, I can't hear you. No, nobody either. It's to go out. I don't used to leave her at home and go out. I go with. I go out with her, I'll put her inside the car and go out. Nobody to stay with her. In the past few weeks of earning factors such as professional commitment, financial constraints for health challenges influence how you fees, and based on this. These special therapists are attention caregiver used to allow her to allow the person to come, but now there is no financial support again from anybody. So I had to go and. I had to carry out to the government hospital for caring. Yes, there is no changes cause I don't have any money. I'm not. I'm not financially buoyant now. Sorry, I can't hear. Yes, I can't hear you. Fair enough. I'm I'm fair enough. Fair enough. Health my isn't my home or my mother's health. My health. At least I'm copying a little. I get tired. Stress is too much for me. I get tired every now and then. I'm because I'm taking care of my mother because I'm I'm a caregiver to my mother. I've not seen any support from anyone. I work remotely. And just work for three hours and remaining hours is for taking care of her. No, he's answer my mother. I'm doing it because of my mother. I'll just make sure that I have given her her drugs, her food, and then I'll start working. It has reduced my wages. Like. Like 2 weeks ago now when I was working she she was awake. I had to stop the work when I was what? What? I had to stop what I was doing then attended. Attend to her. And this has. Affected me in a lot of ways. What do I do? Ah, I used to give her more than. More than 10 hours. As a key given, do you sometimes feel concerned about what the future holds for you in that room? If so, could you share more about it? What kind of help or support will bear for you? The Economist question as a caregiver, do you sometimes feel concerned about the future? What the future holds for you in that? If so, yes, yes, yes, because I need a partner. I will still have, I'll, I'm going to give birth, have my husband and get married one day. So I need an assistant. I need a partner too. Yes. No, no, no, no. No. Please repeat the question. I can't hear you. Yes. Yes, I'm here. I'm here. I need to dedicate my time to her. The voting of attention to. And financial support. I can't remember, not really. I can't remember anything now. Like the moment I I went to go and look for some jobs to do. And she needs my attention. So I had to attend to her before going. She can Remember Me. I show her some old videos of ours, some pictures and lots more. She she react amazingly. She goes into her room when someone. Comes in. As in she as she reacts amazingly, sometimes not every time. No, no, no, she doesn't. No, she remembers me. No, no, no. I don't used to allow her to go outside alone. Two times in a week. No, no, not him. Stressful.\",\n          \"OK, my name is. Yeah. My name is John Smith. I am 26 years old and I am a child to the, you know, the person with dementia. Is my father, OK? And I'm the only one who is the major caregiver. OK, answering question one well. For the past few weeks. Yeah, it's about 7 years, 7 to 8 years. He's 57. Why so? Weak. Yeah, I'm. I'm always with him. He stays with me. We stay together. So before going to my job, I ensure he's fine. I provide every basic things he needs. You know he slowed his, his emails, his phone calls, voicemails he has, and sure everything are kept in check. And sure, he's using his medication. They are all set before I go to my job at my job. I always calling I calling at least twice. To check on him to make sure he's doing fine, make sure he's not having any reaction or side effects to the medication. Make sure he's resting. One is supposed to make sure he's doing the little exercise that has been prepared for him. You know when I'm back. Also, I take him, we go for a walk, take a stroll around. We do little exercise. Sometimes we go to church together. There. And sure, he also eats well, eat fruits, eats the necessary things. Those use medication, those little exercise, then also on the days of his visit to the hospital. And sure, I take him there on time. I'm always saying while he's in the. Doctor. We are done, you know, come back home. So it's just like a normal thing you do for your child. So it I immediately I'm responsible for most of the things. OK, someone says that. OK, well, for the past few weeks I would say the pressure is much more lesser than before. Then I had you know, when we first started, it was a lot for me to taking balancing being a caregiver and also having a full time job. It's really, really tough. It's really tough. And then being at an entry level, someone with little or no, you know superiority, I have buses, which I'm also under their command. You know, it's really hard to have my wish in time like that. So then also it's it's always very difficult coping with the new development. You know things your father can do before easily before you find it. You say that he's having a hard time doing them and you always just have to be around and ensuring that it does it right. So it's always very tough to take in. It's really hard to believe that this is happening. So for for the past few weeks. Ice after that I'm finding it a little bit more easier because I've let it become part of me. I've let it become something I do, you know, not because I want to receive an award for some, you know, some people work because they just want to get a pay. Some people do some things because they just want to, you know, receive profits from it. But when you do something because of the. All of you have for the person. You don't count it as something that, even if it's not reciprocated. Well, you don't see it as anything, so I've learned to teach myself to do it because I love my father and my parents and I would. I'm willing to go extra mile to make sure they're OK. They're fine because they've also sacrificed a lot for me. And so for the past few weeks, I have made it my habits, you know, something I do without being for something I do without seeing it. That's a hard job, though. There's a lot of challenge, definitely a lot of challenge. Tell him something. He forgets it easily has few reactions. Some things you did yesterday. You can remember some things. You know, a lot of things, a lot of challenges, but I've learned to just calm down. You know, sometimes when it's overwhelming, I just take a. Walk. Or just listen to music or just do something to calm me myself down because I cannot be transferring aggression to him. I cannot show any sign of no anger and any other things because. It would really, really affect his own well-being, so I rather would rather take a walk on his throat, or rather just turn my earbuds on and listen to loud music. Or. Just do something to just chill off before I can actually think on what next to. Do. So I would say I'm really coping nicely and I'm finding strategies to make it much more easier for me. So that's how that is. OK. Well, relationship with friends, family and colleagues definitely there is a shift. I spend more time at home. Apart from my job, apart from my job, you know most times then I would love to socialize, you know, visit friends, go to watch a game, go to at the club, go to lottery houses, you know. I spent my most of my free times there. My weekends, you know, I'm socializing. I'm hanging out. I'm doing a lot of stuff. Sports. Now I have to spend there with my parents, my. Dad. Because he needs the care and everything is getting better though, but he needs the care so. That's affected my relationship with my friends. And well, it makes me and my wife have much more time together since I'm spending more time at home with my father and she's always around too. So but with my friends, that's really severed relationship. We do a lot of call video calls, you know, voice calls to kind of compensate for. May not being able to show up there. Sometimes that some occasions will clash with the days he has to go to the hospital and I just have to. Cancel. The occasion, you know, so it's really done a little to that, my friends, my colleagues, you know, my colleague, maybe. Having a birthday celebration at his home or he's having an occasion and it's classes with sometime. By the time I have to just be. With my dad. So. Most of them do actually understand. They understand my situation and they don't get annoyed, but definitely I would say it has really affected it has made me more introvert. No staying indoors. And. Just loving things I can do indoors, you know, and I only go out when I have to. Apart from my job. Sometimes I take. My dad also sees to see a game because he loves basketball. So we go to watch some basketball. Sometimes makes him more happy, makes him lively. You know, you see him celebrate him when he sees. Says he hook. He goes cold and some other things makes him more lively, you know, it adds makes health better and some other things. So that's pretty much how when I go out and then the relationship with my friends and colleagues, it has done a little damage to it, definitely. Definitely it is. It is I it has. It is about where it's stopping me from going out and it's making me spend more time at home, spend more time with my dad, just ensuring that. Things are going as it should so, but I don't see that. As you know, when you people say barrier, you know it's something very negative, something terrible, something you don't want to, but it is what it is. And now I'm not seeing it as a barrier. I'm just saying that is that how can I describe it as an alternative? You know, I'm learning a new way of life instead of being that you know. Extroverts talk so much going out, partying, having so much fun, spending money, wasting money and wasting time doing some other. Things. I now taking all those energies and transfer it into something useful apart from while I'm even caregiving, I have some remote things I do I trade crypto, I do some other things, so I want to say it's a barrier anymore. It has taught me how to actually invest in myself and do things while I'm at home, so that also helped me in a way. OK. Well, in my decision making process, I think. No real change, no real change, no real change. Any decision I need to make, you know, in regards. To. Him. Sometimes he actually is able to make few decisions, sometimes you know, explaining some things to him he doesn't understand. We write it down and let him greet, or we play it and let him listen to it very slowly. And then if he understands, he can make some decisions. He makes about 50% of decisions and I make about 50. So in regards to him, I don't think there is any change in my decision making process and then it's more than fine. I think twice before I make any decisions, I compare my alternatives. I consider a lot of choices before I can actually make a decision, but as regards myself well, some decisions I make as regards my own life. I shared this with my wife. There's no real need of sharing with my dad, because even if I shared with him before tomorrow, he forgets or something like that. So my decisions as regards myself, my family, I don't really share them with him because he don't really are remembers most of those things and the few ones that actually you know like maybe. Ah ohh. It's your granddaughter birthday. Or it's your grandson's birthday or something like that. Ohh it's your. It's your wife's birthday or it's my birthday. You know, things like that. That they're just for the moment. So we share those with him. But you know, real issues as regarding my decision making process. I don't share that. With him and. There is no change. You know when you say change in decision making process, maybe because I'm frustrated. I make certain decisions or because I'm angry, I make certain decisions I've taught myself so much to be able to control all those, calm myself down, take it through, listen to good music, do something that just, you know, it's a little stressful now. Then when I'm come, when I'm settled, I can now think my. Way out of making a very good decision because when you make decisions when you are annoyed most times it is end of the time. There are no good decisions because at that point I won't say you've lost your mind, but you are totally out. Of yourself and. Such situation might be really, really terrible and have nasty consequences, so I've taught myself how. To control them. Yeah, that that is definitely true. That's definitely true. Caregiving. Yes, definitely, it does affect it affects those decisions. You know, I, before I go for any vacation of stuff, I have to plan it very well and it sure it doesn't clash with you stuffs, especially critical visits to the hospitals. The. So I make sure any vacation or something doesn't tamper with that. Well about location, I have a home here, so I don't see any circumstance of me, you know, moving out of this area for at least for the next 1020 years. So I love this place. I settled in and I think I'm doing fine. So but. If there would be maybe a case or maybe any circumstance that would actually need the relocation or movement, I think there even would definitely be a barrier because we have to actually transfer hospitals and then get a stable around the place where we are. And feed them with all the previous information they need to know and then continue doing it there, because it definitely is a factor I would consider before I make such kinds of huge decisions, you know, decisions that would really affect him, like me going on vacation or locating or going for holidays somewhere or something. It is a. Major function that I have to consider. OK, now commitment page. Yeah, definitely. Professional commitment, yes. And Eversource definitely, they have affected some things with us. 04/20 OK yeah, self keep practicing. Yeah, manage daily stress. Describe yourself here, properties and past weeks. Might the stress of caregiving share strategies? OK, well, self-care practices. Like I said, sometimes it gets very frustrating. You know, sometimes some things you tell him you forget. It's really annoying because sometimes it's annoying. Definitely any normal person will get annoyed with some things. Like I said in previous recordings I have taught myself to manage these stresses. It wasn't a day's job or two years job or three years. Job. It's been over 7 years now. So. I go for a walk when I'm having. When I'm feeling stress, you know, having gone to my full time job makes a lot of difficulties and stuffs problems and every other thing. And I'm coming back and then I just want peace. Then I'm still having a lot of things to deal with, you know, frustration sets in. Terrible mood swings, anger and every other thing. So I learned to take a walk, you know, once it's not that it's in a critical situation where I need to be there. I will just take a walk or I just go to my music room, put on my earbuds, listen to music or play the piano, or do something that would ease my stress. And I just even go to sitting room and just watch Netflix. And just laugh, laugh out sometimes and then. Is the stress away, so some of the strategies have actually been employing and sure I go away from that. You know, I I go away from where he is and just try to ease the with the stress and then. And then sometimes. And then sometimes. I just you know. I just try to cope with it. I makes the decisions not to get annoyed. You know, some things are supposed to make you annoyed and then. To see. Why am I? Why am I? Why am I even getting annoyed for no reason? Listen, isn't something much that should get me annoyed? And then I just flush out the thought of being annoyed and then take it as something normal. So. I think those are some of the major strategies I have employed as regards coping with daily stresses and every other stuff. How frequently? I'll say 5, I'll say majorly five days a week. The five days I got my job. Definitely very stressful. Well. I would say is about him keeping to his routine. He knows what he should be doing at this time. He knows what he should be doing at that time. And then you ask him, have you done this? Ohh, I've done it. Then you find out he's not done it, OK. He has a call. He has a check up call from the hospital while I'm at my job. And he's not. He's not picking them up. He's not answering. And he say, oh, have you done this and say ohh, I don't even know. That I should. Have done that and then you prepare. You want to eat this food and then you make it and then you bring it and he doesn't want to eat it anymore. He wants to eat something else. You know, a lot of those things come up. Those are just a few of the examples and it's very stressful and very annoying. That's the fifth one, right? Yeah. Yeah, factors such as professional commitment, financial constraints, yes. Our professional commitment definitely you know there was a time I should. You know have. I my company was planning to actually sponsor me on a trip to, I think to the United Kingdom you. Know. For a seminar and some other fellowship, and then for some other knowledge and professional stuffs, it was meant to be two weeks. And then I found a way to get someone to stay with him and every other thing, and it just fell apart and I wasn't able to go. It was really painful at that moment. At that moment, I, you know, just had to back out of the opportunity that I had been waiting all my life. For. And then. It was frustrating and terrible. Well, yeah, it is what it is. I have gotten something close. That now so it doesn't pin me so much. And when I think of it so a lot of professional commitments, you know, sometimes I am supposed to do over some over time just to get some extra cash and then I just can't, I just have to be dashing out of the office money time because I have someone. I'm caregiving you. Know. It's really, really frustrating. And then you get home. And you meet some other stress and some other. Things. Frustrating. So I would say professional commitment. Care given standards, A barrier between a lot of professional commitments as far as I'm concerned, then financial constraints or health challenges, well, financial constraints for me at this moment. Well, I thank God, I think I'm I'm I'm above moderate and in a very good salary. My father also you know he's worked some things down for himself. So he has his health insurance and some other things that basically covered by the job and things he has done while he was still active. So I don't really have support and care about financial stuff. It is well available. So I won't say financial constraints is really any problem. Then health changes. Well, sometimes I also fall sick and then the sick person still caring for a sick person. So I try my as best as much as I as I can not to. Fall sick. But when I do I well, my wife actually takes the. Takes the responsibility of. Doing what I've been doing, so I think that's basically it. I get distracted. Get a lot of distraction, a lot, lots of distraction. You know, sometimes he just makes some emergency call and then you pick up and you be like, what's up? And says, I just want to hear your voice. You know, and that would be really annoying. Like you call me five times and just want to hear my voice for what? And then I'm just, you know, I see your call. I'm panicking now. Maybe something is wrong and I just have to pick it up. You know, sometimes you see your. Call. You know my brain and say, oh, I'm busy or you just shoot them a text. I'm busy. I'll call you later. And then that's all. And when you are done with job, you call them. But you see the call, you know. It you know, is someone OK given for. So you just have to pick it up and then you say ohh I just want to hear your voice. Why just want to do this and then you be like don't call. Me like this when I see your call. I have to pick up because. Of this and that don't just call, because when I hear my voice, I'm busy at my job and some other things, and then he doesn't hear and he keeps calling. So I get distracted a lot. So, but it's part of the job of caregiving, definitely. Well, yes, definitely. There are some positions I want us to be promoted to, but it's going to definitely hit hit into the time of my care given. So I've declined few of those offers. And then I hope it gets very, very much more better soon then I can have less hours care given and then maybe take some professional, you know promotions. No, I sleep well. I sleep well. Eat good. He sleeps very. He sleeps very early and he wakes up late, so I hardly have any issues. At night I sleep well. For me or for him? No, no, no, no, none of those. OK. And do you sometimes feel concerned about what the future holds for you in the room? Yeah, definitely. I definitely think about that. I definitely think about that. I've table that, you know, in the family meetings and some other stuff. So, you know, no one is willing to take responsibility. Everyone's busy. Everyone is doing this and that and it just feels. Like I just have to keep doing this forever and then I think that, well, I've actually declined a lot of professional things. I should have, you know, gotten promoted and getting costing me more money, getting me, you know, some other things and. Then. This cake even is staying as a barrier and some other things and. You know, just thinking about some other things. So I definitely have the thoughts most of the time what the future holds for me in this role because if it continues like this for a long time, you know I would have. To decline a. Lot. Of offers along the line, and I might still be in the same. Position for years, so I consider that and then I'm hoping very soon that one actually have enough finances. We can actually transfer him to a stable, you know, professional home where we have professional caregivers and stuff like that. But the utmost prayer is that his conditions improve, and then we actually have less hours of caregiving. And then. We are still caregivers that day, but we have less hours because he cannot do many things by himself. Well, doctors are promised that that is a possibility in the nearest future. We are also hoping that God, if that is possible, but if that doesn't work out, then at some point I. Won't. Be considering I would be considering. Professional caregiving homes. So I guess that's it about that. Well, the truth is, if I have someone, someone else, if we can run something like a shift when I'm active for these two days a week and then he's active for another two days and match for another two days, or I'm asking for 12 hours a day and then he takes the other 12 hours. You know, something like that, it would ease me of a lot of stress, a lot of burdens. And then. If possibly if we have enough finances and we can just move him to a professional place, you know those ones, they don't see it as a task. They've been trained for that and then they do it to any living. So that's their job. They don't have something else. To stop. In them so. I think those might be the two great options. OK. Yeah, definitely, definitely. I think about that by the percent of the time. First of all, it's financial basis and then also we've had a lot of stories about professional caregivers, you know, neglect and terrible happenings that we've had. That doesn't want he he he kicks, he kicks against it. He doesn't want it. We've actually brought up in some meetings where the family is willing to donate and then get that done. But he himself doesn't want that. He says if we try that and he gets escaped from there, he's gonna run off and do some of that stuffs. You know, it's really hard. He doesn't want it. And then we also we are concerned about the risk. So that's why we're not really implemented. He forgets a lot very frequently. Ohh me. No, he doesn't forget me. He doesn't forget me. He knows me, he knows me. Mostly forget some other family members, but not not me, not me. And doesn't remember them. Yeah, definitely. Like, oh, what are you? What are you looking for? You know sometimes like, oh, oh, John, I have a stranger in this house. It's trying to come to the front door doing this and that, you know, I've had calls like that when my wife, you know, my wife was back at her job and then he called me up. Ohh John, I have this a woman, a lady at my door. I don't know what she's looking for. Can you call the cops? Can you do this? And I'm like it's my wife for God's. Sake. So you have issues like that so, but he's not aggressive towards them. He just wants to know who is who and what is what. And I'm sure he's safe. I would say progressive. Out to neutral. Yeah. So I don't read it, read it. Well, I feel I might share my experiences and then I was thinking maybe there are some resources that can actually help me caregiving journey, maybe something like that would also be shared during the meeting. So those are the things. I'm looking for.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It has been a negative life for me that's reduced my parting, my, my, my studies, everything about me. So it has been a difficult life life for me. Going to parties. I'm going to school too. I have stopped schools and I have been taking care of my mother. I have stopped school. There is no positive moment. In financial aspects, I don't have any money to take care of her again.

Describe, OK, giving assisting you about well-being the past few weeks. Regarding your relationship with family, friends, or comics to the Internet, changes or shifts. Relationships. The question too I have not. I have not noticed any changes. It has been the way I have been given my life for the past five years. Yep. My family and friends have run away because I'm taking care of my mother. So I'm I'm the only one with her now. No, no, no, no. Sorry, I can't hear you. No, it doesn't affect me.\\\", \\\" Oh. My communication, my communication and my attention has been shot with my family and friends. My colleagues in the world in the school too. I invite only one of my friends has told by me for the past four years. Five years. So even if I should call her, call her, she will take like two to three days before she come to me. Yes, yes. I can't hear you please. Please repeat. I can't hear you. Yes. Sorry, question 3, right? My family, I I told you the other time. But my family and friends are no more. They have. They have gone. They left me alone. It's only one of my friends that stay with me. Whenever I call her. She used to take three to four days to come. OK. Over the past few weeks, have you and the kids are not engineers intention making process. You. Yes please. My decision making has changed. Due to the food I eat at home. Financial everything. Because of the of my mother's sickness. Yes, yes, I do think about her. I have to put her into consideration first. Number four question, describe your self-care practices in the past few weeks to manage the daily stresses of caregiving, share your strategy strategies that have been particularly helpful in coping with the steady stress of caregiving. OK, #1. The time I cook for her. Time I do, I do take care of her. Time of caring, time of management. Time of making her happy. That's OK, then that's what I can say for that number four question please. I go on social media. Will I surf the Internet? To rest, I used to rest.\\\", \\\" Whenever I take care of us and I. Whenever she is asleep, I used to sleep too. I used to take a rest. My make sure I wake up before. I used to sleep very well before and go out, go to schools, go to clubs. I used to party very well, but now I don't used to do that again. I used to drive I I will put on a car and drive out wherever, whenever, wherever I'm going. Sorry, I can't hear you. No, nobody either. It's to go out. I don't used to leave her at home and go out. I go with. I go out with her, I'll put her inside the car and go out. Nobody to stay with her. In the past few weeks of earning factors such as professional commitment, financial constraints for health challenges influence how you fees, and based on this. These special therapists are attention caregiver used to allow her to allow the person to come, but now there is no financial support again from anybody. So I had to go and. I had to carry out to the government hospital for caring. Yes, there is no changes cause I don't have any money. I'm not. I'm not financially buoyant now. Sorry, I can't hear. Yes, I can't hear you. Fair enough. I'm I'm fair enough. Fair enough. Health my isn't my home or my mother's health. My health. At least I'm copying a little. I get tired. Stress is too much for me. I get tired every now and then. I'm because I'm taking care of my mother because I'm I'm a caregiver to my mother. I've not seen any support from anyone. I work remotely.\\\", \\\" And just work for three hours and remaining hours is for taking care of her. No, he's answer my mother. I'm doing it because of my mother. I'll just make sure that I have given her her drugs, her food, and then I'll start working. It has reduced my wages. Like. Like 2 weeks ago now when I was working she she was awake. I had to stop the work when I was what? What? I had to stop what I was doing then attended. Attend to her. And this has. Affected me in a lot of ways. What do I do? Ah, I used to give her more than. More than 10 hours. As a key given, do you sometimes feel concerned about what the future holds for you in that room? If so, could you share more about it? What kind of help or support will bear for you? The Economist question as a caregiver, do you sometimes feel concerned about the future? What the future holds for you in that? If so, yes, yes, yes, because I need a partner. I will still have, I'll, I'm going to give birth, have my husband and get married one day. So I need an assistant. I need a partner too. Yes. No, no, no, no. No. Please repeat the question. I can't hear you. Yes. Yes, I'm here. I'm here. I need to dedicate my time to her. The voting of attention to. And financial support. I can't remember, not really. I can't remember anything now. Like the moment I I went to go and look for some jobs to do. And she needs my attention. So I had to attend to her before going. She can Remember Me. I show her some old videos of ours, some pictures and lots more.\\\", \\\" She she react amazingly. She goes into her room when someone. Comes in. As in she as she reacts amazingly, sometimes not every time. No, no, no, she doesn't. No, she remembers me. No, no, no. I don't used to allow her to go outside alone. Two times in a week. No, no, not him. Stressful.\\\"]\",\n          \"[\\\"OK, my name is. Yeah. My name is John Smith. I am 26 years old and I am a child to the, you know, the person with dementia. Is my father, OK? And I'm the only one who is the major caregiver. OK, answering question one well. For the past few weeks. Yeah, it's about 7 years, 7 to 8 years. He's 57. Why so? Weak. Yeah, I'm. I'm always with him. He stays with me. We stay together. So before going to my job, I ensure he's fine. I provide every basic things he needs. You know he slowed his, his emails, his phone calls, voicemails he has, and sure everything are kept in check. And sure, he's using his medication. They are all set before I go to my job at my job. I always calling I calling at least twice. To check on him to make sure he's doing fine, make sure he's not having any reaction or side effects to the medication. Make sure he's resting. One is supposed to make sure he's doing the little exercise that has been prepared for him. You know when I'm back. Also, I take him, we go for a walk, take a stroll around. We do little exercise. Sometimes we go to church together. There. And sure, he also eats well, eat fruits, eats the necessary things. Those use medication, those little exercise, then also on the days of his visit to the hospital. And sure, I take him there on time. I'm always saying while he's in the. Doctor. We are done, you know, come back home. So it's just like a normal thing you do for your child. So it I immediately I'm responsible for most of the things.\\\", \\\" OK, someone says that. OK, well, for the past few weeks I would say the pressure is much more lesser than before. Then I had you know, when we first started, it was a lot for me to taking balancing being a caregiver and also having a full time job. It's really, really tough. It's really tough. And then being at an entry level, someone with little or no, you know superiority, I have buses, which I'm also under their command. You know, it's really hard to have my wish in time like that. So then also it's it's always very difficult coping with the new development. You know things your father can do before easily before you find it. You say that he's having a hard time doing them and you always just have to be around and ensuring that it does it right. So it's always very tough to take in. It's really hard to believe that this is happening. So for for the past few weeks. Ice after that I'm finding it a little bit more easier because I've let it become part of me. I've let it become something I do, you know, not because I want to receive an award for some, you know, some people work because they just want to get a pay. Some people do some things because they just want to, you know, receive profits from it. But when you do something because of the. All of you have for the person. You don't count it as something that, even if it's not reciprocated. Well, you don't see it as anything, so I've learned to teach myself to do it because I love my father and my parents and I would.\\\", \\\" I'm willing to go extra mile to make sure they're OK. They're fine because they've also sacrificed a lot for me. And so for the past few weeks, I have made it my habits, you know, something I do without being for something I do without seeing it. That's a hard job, though. There's a lot of challenge, definitely a lot of challenge. Tell him something. He forgets it easily has few reactions. Some things you did yesterday. You can remember some things. You know, a lot of things, a lot of challenges, but I've learned to just calm down. You know, sometimes when it's overwhelming, I just take a. Walk. Or just listen to music or just do something to calm me myself down because I cannot be transferring aggression to him. I cannot show any sign of no anger and any other things because. It would really, really affect his own well-being, so I rather would rather take a walk on his throat, or rather just turn my earbuds on and listen to loud music. Or. Just do something to just chill off before I can actually think on what next to. Do. So I would say I'm really coping nicely and I'm finding strategies to make it much more easier for me. So that's how that is. OK. Well, relationship with friends, family and colleagues definitely there is a shift. I spend more time at home. Apart from my job, apart from my job, you know most times then I would love to socialize, you know, visit friends, go to watch a game, go to at the club, go to lottery houses, you know.\\\", \\\" I spent my most of my free times there. My weekends, you know, I'm socializing. I'm hanging out. I'm doing a lot of stuff. Sports. Now I have to spend there with my parents, my. Dad. Because he needs the care and everything is getting better though, but he needs the care so. That's affected my relationship with my friends. And well, it makes me and my wife have much more time together since I'm spending more time at home with my father and she's always around too. So but with my friends, that's really severed relationship. We do a lot of call video calls, you know, voice calls to kind of compensate for. May not being able to show up there. Sometimes that some occasions will clash with the days he has to go to the hospital and I just have to. Cancel. The occasion, you know, so it's really done a little to that, my friends, my colleagues, you know, my colleague, maybe. Having a birthday celebration at his home or he's having an occasion and it's classes with sometime. By the time I have to just be. With my dad. So. Most of them do actually understand. They understand my situation and they don't get annoyed, but definitely I would say it has really affected it has made me more introvert. No staying indoors. And. Just loving things I can do indoors, you know, and I only go out when I have to. Apart from my job. Sometimes I take. My dad also sees to see a game because he loves basketball. So we go to watch some basketball. Sometimes makes him more happy, makes him lively.\\\", \\\" You know, you see him celebrate him when he sees. Says he hook. He goes cold and some other things makes him more lively, you know, it adds makes health better and some other things. So that's pretty much how when I go out and then the relationship with my friends and colleagues, it has done a little damage to it, definitely. Definitely it is. It is I it has. It is about where it's stopping me from going out and it's making me spend more time at home, spend more time with my dad, just ensuring that. Things are going as it should so, but I don't see that. As you know, when you people say barrier, you know it's something very negative, something terrible, something you don't want to, but it is what it is. And now I'm not seeing it as a barrier. I'm just saying that is that how can I describe it as an alternative? You know, I'm learning a new way of life instead of being that you know. Extroverts talk so much going out, partying, having so much fun, spending money, wasting money and wasting time doing some other. Things. I now taking all those energies and transfer it into something useful apart from while I'm even caregiving, I have some remote things I do I trade crypto, I do some other things, so I want to say it's a barrier anymore. It has taught me how to actually invest in myself and do things while I'm at home, so that also helped me in a way. OK. Well, in my decision making process, I think. No real change, no real change, no real change.\\\", \\\" Any decision I need to make, you know, in regards. To. Him. Sometimes he actually is able to make few decisions, sometimes you know, explaining some things to him he doesn't understand. We write it down and let him greet, or we play it and let him listen to it very slowly. And then if he understands, he can make some decisions. He makes about 50% of decisions and I make about 50. So in regards to him, I don't think there is any change in my decision making process and then it's more than fine. I think twice before I make any decisions, I compare my alternatives. I consider a lot of choices before I can actually make a decision, but as regards myself well, some decisions I make as regards my own life. I shared this with my wife. There's no real need of sharing with my dad, because even if I shared with him before tomorrow, he forgets or something like that. So my decisions as regards myself, my family, I don't really share them with him because he don't really are remembers most of those things and the few ones that actually you know like maybe. Ah ohh. It's your granddaughter birthday. Or it's your grandson's birthday or something like that. Ohh it's your. It's your wife's birthday or it's my birthday. You know, things like that. That they're just for the moment. So we share those with him. But you know, real issues as regarding my decision making process. I don't share that. With him and. There is no change.\\\", \\\" You know when you say change in decision making process, maybe because I'm frustrated. I make certain decisions or because I'm angry, I make certain decisions I've taught myself so much to be able to control all those, calm myself down, take it through, listen to good music, do something that just, you know, it's a little stressful now. Then when I'm come, when I'm settled, I can now think my. Way out of making a very good decision because when you make decisions when you are annoyed most times it is end of the time. There are no good decisions because at that point I won't say you've lost your mind, but you are totally out. Of yourself and. Such situation might be really, really terrible and have nasty consequences, so I've taught myself how. To control them. Yeah, that that is definitely true. That's definitely true. Caregiving. Yes, definitely, it does affect it affects those decisions. You know, I, before I go for any vacation of stuff, I have to plan it very well and it sure it doesn't clash with you stuffs, especially critical visits to the hospitals. The. So I make sure any vacation or something doesn't tamper with that. Well about location, I have a home here, so I don't see any circumstance of me, you know, moving out of this area for at least for the next 1020 years. So I love this place. I settled in and I think I'm doing fine. So but.\\\", \\\" If there would be maybe a case or maybe any circumstance that would actually need the relocation or movement, I think there even would definitely be a barrier because we have to actually transfer hospitals and then get a stable around the place where we are. And feed them with all the previous information they need to know and then continue doing it there, because it definitely is a factor I would consider before I make such kinds of huge decisions, you know, decisions that would really affect him, like me going on vacation or locating or going for holidays somewhere or something. It is a. Major function that I have to consider. OK, now commitment page. Yeah, definitely. Professional commitment, yes. And Eversource definitely, they have affected some things with us. 04/20 OK yeah, self keep practicing. Yeah, manage daily stress. Describe yourself here, properties and past weeks. Might the stress of caregiving share strategies? OK, well, self-care practices. Like I said, sometimes it gets very frustrating. You know, sometimes some things you tell him you forget. It's really annoying because sometimes it's annoying. Definitely any normal person will get annoyed with some things. Like I said in previous recordings I have taught myself to manage these stresses. It wasn't a day's job or two years job or three years. Job. It's been over 7 years now. So. I go for a walk when I'm having.\\\", \\\" When I'm feeling stress, you know, having gone to my full time job makes a lot of difficulties and stuffs problems and every other thing. And I'm coming back and then I just want peace. Then I'm still having a lot of things to deal with, you know, frustration sets in. Terrible mood swings, anger and every other thing. So I learned to take a walk, you know, once it's not that it's in a critical situation where I need to be there. I will just take a walk or I just go to my music room, put on my earbuds, listen to music or play the piano, or do something that would ease my stress. And I just even go to sitting room and just watch Netflix. And just laugh, laugh out sometimes and then. Is the stress away, so some of the strategies have actually been employing and sure I go away from that. You know, I I go away from where he is and just try to ease the with the stress and then. And then sometimes. And then sometimes. I just you know. I just try to cope with it. I makes the decisions not to get annoyed. You know, some things are supposed to make you annoyed and then. To see. Why am I? Why am I? Why am I even getting annoyed for no reason? Listen, isn't something much that should get me annoyed? And then I just flush out the thought of being annoyed and then take it as something normal. So. I think those are some of the major strategies I have employed as regards coping with daily stresses and every other stuff. How frequently? I'll say 5, I'll say majorly five days a week.\\\", \\\" The five days I got my job. Definitely very stressful. Well. I would say is about him keeping to his routine. He knows what he should be doing at this time. He knows what he should be doing at that time. And then you ask him, have you done this? Ohh, I've done it. Then you find out he's not done it, OK. He has a call. He has a check up call from the hospital while I'm at my job. And he's not. He's not picking them up. He's not answering. And he say, oh, have you done this and say ohh, I don't even know. That I should. Have done that and then you prepare. You want to eat this food and then you make it and then you bring it and he doesn't want to eat it anymore. He wants to eat something else. You know, a lot of those things come up. Those are just a few of the examples and it's very stressful and very annoying. That's the fifth one, right? Yeah. Yeah, factors such as professional commitment, financial constraints, yes. Our professional commitment definitely you know there was a time I should. You know have. I my company was planning to actually sponsor me on a trip to, I think to the United Kingdom you. Know. For a seminar and some other fellowship, and then for some other knowledge and professional stuffs, it was meant to be two weeks. And then I found a way to get someone to stay with him and every other thing, and it just fell apart and I wasn't able to go. It was really painful at that moment.\\\", \\\" At that moment, I, you know, just had to back out of the opportunity that I had been waiting all my life. For. And then. It was frustrating and terrible. Well, yeah, it is what it is. I have gotten something close. That now so it doesn't pin me so much. And when I think of it so a lot of professional commitments, you know, sometimes I am supposed to do over some over time just to get some extra cash and then I just can't, I just have to be dashing out of the office money time because I have someone. I'm caregiving you. Know. It's really, really frustrating. And then you get home. And you meet some other stress and some other. Things. Frustrating. So I would say professional commitment. Care given standards, A barrier between a lot of professional commitments as far as I'm concerned, then financial constraints or health challenges, well, financial constraints for me at this moment. Well, I thank God, I think I'm I'm I'm above moderate and in a very good salary. My father also you know he's worked some things down for himself. So he has his health insurance and some other things that basically covered by the job and things he has done while he was still active. So I don't really have support and care about financial stuff. It is well available. So I won't say financial constraints is really any problem. Then health changes. Well, sometimes I also fall sick and then the sick person still caring for a sick person. So I try my as best as much as I as I can not to. Fall sick.\\\", \\\" But when I do I well, my wife actually takes the. Takes the responsibility of. Doing what I've been doing, so I think that's basically it. I get distracted. Get a lot of distraction, a lot, lots of distraction. You know, sometimes he just makes some emergency call and then you pick up and you be like, what's up? And says, I just want to hear your voice. You know, and that would be really annoying. Like you call me five times and just want to hear my voice for what? And then I'm just, you know, I see your call. I'm panicking now. Maybe something is wrong and I just have to pick it up. You know, sometimes you see your. Call. You know my brain and say, oh, I'm busy or you just shoot them a text. I'm busy. I'll call you later. And then that's all. And when you are done with job, you call them. But you see the call, you know. It you know, is someone OK given for. So you just have to pick it up and then you say ohh I just want to hear your voice. Why just want to do this and then you be like don't call. Me like this when I see your call. I have to pick up because. Of this and that don't just call, because when I hear my voice, I'm busy at my job and some other things, and then he doesn't hear and he keeps calling. So I get distracted a lot. So, but it's part of the job of caregiving, definitely. Well, yes, definitely. There are some positions I want us to be promoted to, but it's going to definitely hit hit into the time of my care given. So I've declined few of those offers.\\\", \\\" And then I hope it gets very, very much more better soon then I can have less hours care given and then maybe take some professional, you know promotions. No, I sleep well. I sleep well. Eat good. He sleeps very. He sleeps very early and he wakes up late, so I hardly have any issues. At night I sleep well. For me or for him? No, no, no, no, none of those. OK. And do you sometimes feel concerned about what the future holds for you in the room? Yeah, definitely. I definitely think about that. I definitely think about that. I've table that, you know, in the family meetings and some other stuff. So, you know, no one is willing to take responsibility. Everyone's busy. Everyone is doing this and that and it just feels. Like I just have to keep doing this forever and then I think that, well, I've actually declined a lot of professional things. I should have, you know, gotten promoted and getting costing me more money, getting me, you know, some other things and. Then. This cake even is staying as a barrier and some other things and. You know, just thinking about some other things. So I definitely have the thoughts most of the time what the future holds for me in this role because if it continues like this for a long time, you know I would have. To decline a. Lot. Of offers along the line, and I might still be in the same. Position for years, so I consider that and then I'm hoping very soon that one actually have enough finances.\\\", \\\" We can actually transfer him to a stable, you know, professional home where we have professional caregivers and stuff like that. But the utmost prayer is that his conditions improve, and then we actually have less hours of caregiving. And then. We are still caregivers that day, but we have less hours because he cannot do many things by himself. Well, doctors are promised that that is a possibility in the nearest future. We are also hoping that God, if that is possible, but if that doesn't work out, then at some point I. Won't. Be considering I would be considering. Professional caregiving homes. So I guess that's it about that. Well, the truth is, if I have someone, someone else, if we can run something like a shift when I'm active for these two days a week and then he's active for another two days and match for another two days, or I'm asking for 12 hours a day and then he takes the other 12 hours. You know, something like that, it would ease me of a lot of stress, a lot of burdens. And then. If possibly if we have enough finances and we can just move him to a professional place, you know those ones, they don't see it as a task. They've been trained for that and then they do it to any living. So that's their job. They don't have something else. To stop. In them so. I think those might be the two great options. OK. Yeah, definitely, definitely. I think about that by the percent of the time.\\\", \\\" First of all, it's financial basis and then also we've had a lot of stories about professional caregivers, you know, neglect and terrible happenings that we've had. That doesn't want he he he kicks, he kicks against it. He doesn't want it. We've actually brought up in some meetings where the family is willing to donate and then get that done. But he himself doesn't want that. He says if we try that and he gets escaped from there, he's gonna run off and do some of that stuffs. You know, it's really hard. He doesn't want it. And then we also we are concerned about the risk. So that's why we're not really implemented. He forgets a lot very frequently. Ohh me. No, he doesn't forget me. He doesn't forget me. He knows me, he knows me. Mostly forget some other family members, but not not me, not me. And doesn't remember them. Yeah, definitely. Like, oh, what are you? What are you looking for? You know sometimes like, oh, oh, John, I have a stranger in this house. It's trying to come to the front door doing this and that, you know, I've had calls like that when my wife, you know, my wife was back at her job and then he called me up. Ohh John, I have this a woman, a lady at my door. I don't know what she's looking for. Can you call the cops? Can you do this? And I'm like it's my wife for God's. Sake. So you have issues like that so, but he's not aggressive towards them. He just wants to know who is who and what is what. And I'm sure he's safe. I would say progressive. Out to neutral.\\\", \\\" Yeah. So I don't read it, read it. Well, I feel I might share my experiences and then I was thinking maybe there are some resources that can actually help me caregiving journey, maybe something like that would also be shared during the meeting. So those are the things. I'm looking for.\\\"]\",\n          \"[\\\"Yeah. Can I read the questions first? OK. Uh, my name is Denmark. OK, can call me Palma. You can call me then. And. But my my real names are Denmark is my parents from the disease. Care of UM. I'm 2523 years. Yes. My audio let me put. Turn the the headphones. OK. Just a minute. Now, now are you hearing me? Yeah. I can now I can. You can. Mark. Yeah. And you and me. When I when I speak. Some few words, then it it begins shaking. Can you? Just send me. Let me. Use the headphone microphone and artificial microphone on the side. I I think that will be very helpful. OK. Can you hear me that way? Yeah. My loved one. Is. 62 years. And told me that I began like. It was like yes. Many years ago. How? I wasn't. 10 years. Now I wasn't aware, but I after like I came. I came to. He's my father, OK? So I came to to realize. Like came. About. Uh, him being the organized. Uh, five years ago began my my. By journey to become a giver. Him. Like like we have to go to the hospital like. Like twice a month, we have a principal. Description of the doctor amount of clinical trials. Twice a month we visit the hospital. And we have. Like some some dose like that for him? Which is given like. Yeah. Yeah, particularly most of the I'm not the only one, but we are like. Two, but I'm like. Like I'm saying like, like most of the time, I'm the one who I'm being with because of my. My job but. Sometimes my brother takes care of him like me, but like everything, I'm the one who I'm usually. Doing. Yeah.\\\", \\\" Uh, let me read the question and answer. Another question myself I can answer like. Like. Like you don't like being a caregiver to. Two people with uh. To people. The person may like my father like and become like sometimes can act truly like insensitive. But when you are here, give a. The main role is like like you have taken yourself and. And new and and familiar job to yourself and you should. Be ready to it. Was positive positive moments. Not that much like, but that I can recall like. Having like 1-2 or two stories that you can make. Daily. And also like. Going. The. Oh, sorry. Going to the game just to play some games. Yeah. Like. Like you see, like for example the most challenging structure is. Like you may have very big trouble. In having conversations is too forgetful, like for example you can. You can ask him something like 5 minutes ago, so you need to be very patient or something, he forgets like. 5 minutes ago. Yes, any question. Yeah, square question. Yeah, like the second question like. Example. Like uh, have to go out like, for example, with my friends sometimes. Sometimes I have cancelled. Out like for example going to the. To the clubs at night. You see, I have cancelled those. Because have I have someone to take care to be with him around. So that's very challenging also like. Like you have to break some relationship with. Think for example those friends that you. I can't understand you making like.\\\", \\\" Like you are not cooperating with them like you are not with them sometimes. See. It's like it's very hard. Like there was a time to go to the. To the to the IT was Christmas. We were planning to go on a tour with my friends. My. Somewhere so. I had to. To cancel everything. Also, there is the time like it's not a job shift. I had to talk with my boss to have me stay with my father. Not. Yeah. Yeah, like for example, it's sometimes very hard to like. You have to like a very big barrier like. You you don't have just to go, you have to fix your. You have to have a for me. I have to wait for my brother when my brother is on at all. So. Or not. So that's when I can have. To go on out. Like for example like uh. Like for example. Myself, I have a friend who usually come. At our house, we stay with him to get stories. You see, it's like a supportive friend. We can say that like. That is very supportive to me. He has been there for me. Like when you when I need him. He usually be there for me like. Yeah. Let me ask you. OK, OK. I've understood the question. Yeah. Can't say yes. You see, like for example. My head, like I was having to relocate to. With the UK some. I'm now clear. Can you hear me now? Yes. Now I'm shaking. No. Imagine I'm just. I'm just in my room, maybe I think. I'm just in my room seated. Can you hear me now? No, I'm using. I'm using the desktop. I'm using my laptop's microphone. I was saying like. Those are time. Yes. Yes, sorry.\\\", \\\" Sample at this time I wanted to move to the UK. Recently, but I had changed my decision. Because of. Of being a caregiver. To my parent, you see you have to like to change everything. Every decision that you are. Take then you just have to be a caregiver. Very well. To be here? Yeah. To make this an environment, to make him feel better. Like. You can't just take a decision. That will have. I can't see that. That I will. I will just have to make my decisions anyhow. I have to have, like a Conservative asked. Like uh, I can. I can. I can answer this way this question for like, uh, in the past few weeks. Like me, myself and mom, I like gaming. And also. Like. One of the way of. Like one of the ways I can. One of the ways I. And. Do like, uh, cooping up with? Managing daily stress is like I usually have computer games like FIFA. Like those are like some of like also like. Or. When my friends come, we stay with him. It's like. That's one of my stress managing factors strategies. That I usually. But. Like daily. Please. You see, like for example. Like this, like my father. Is someone you have to. To cope up with. Do what he says you have to with his decisions, like for example, when maybe he wants to like, like when he wants to lie on a. Which patient? On the floor. You see, you have just to find a mattress. There's no any other way. No other way. You can say that. You'll you'll have. To. To. To to have your decision to have another decision. That's quite challenging.\\\", \\\" But stress and stress is something very common and in giving job. And it's very. Hey. Click. So if you if. You doesn't have a way to manage tests very. And. Like myself. Like myself, I can just tell can just give like a like give us. To have when you are like not that very much busy, you just you just have something you just find yourself something to keep you busy, for example and you just find yourself. You keep yourself busy like you just find yourself doing something. Yeah. And. I can say. They if they have a like. Financial constraints in past few weeks. But. We had, like the insurance, Medicare insurance. Was they have? Yeah. For us. And you know, like that will have like you have to take this person like clinical trials and like like you have to buy this drugs. Control the person. If you're not very. It will be. Very, very hard. Also I can say like. Also this professional. Of professionals who deal with the this disease. There are very few. So you have to have a time table with profession or you have your own personal. Profession. Or else you'll have very hard time for yourself. Yes. Yeah, it's very hard to balance, like for example. Like my myself, I'm a software engineer. I'm a. Freelance software engineer? Yeah. So? So like for example in have a. For example, I have a client, so I actually have to fix a timetable for for him, so I cannot not tell me tomorrow. Come at I'm not free. I have to be. I have to be free first. So that. Hey. I can I have to be free first.\\\", \\\" Then I make a timetable for us to be agree so we can meet. Yes. Like for example I can say. Very many things have changed. Like. Like when I was. In my seventeens I used to be a party boy like I used to go to parties like days. Like covering this like. I don't go very that like daily like I used to like my teenage life is. So it was so different. Like now, very many things changed. Not one, not two. Very many have changed. Yeah. Yeah. The future? Myself, myself, I can maybe in the future I can go to. To the college, to the to, to the, to college, to become a doctor. Professional caregiver. 12 people with dementia. Hmm. To to be like helpful or I can just become an ambassador of this of how to be how to control dementia. And. That's what I can just say. Yeah, myself, I I think to be support that I can be is like like I say like in the future I will go to the. College. To be my doctor, who will be like and like also like giving us giving becoming or becoming a a, a caregiver counselor to care given to us. And coping up with depression. To help them achieve their the future. Like me, myself being. A person with technology like I think I will use a like for example I will use like social media to to communicate to people about how to control stress with stress. How to control. Like I can see use like for example tick tock or like. Instagram Page Special page where you can teach people how to become a good dementia caregiver, like how to use stress free.\\\", \\\" Like that's something of the sort. Just they can just say. For example, you can just. They are giving journey. Like for example you can say. Yeah, like for example the like being in the media to teach people how to become. Good care. Give us like for example, just have that people have that knowledge, for example, they have that knowledge of dementia, how to relieve their stress, how to feed those people, like how to give them good medicines. See, I think that resource would be helpful to many people around the world, not only in the US. And just say it's unfamiliar and. It can save some. It's a new and unfamiliar role, but you just have. Yeah, I can say caregiving job is challenging. Yeah. It was through. This app it's called Reddit. Myself, I decided to participate in this research to help, for example. Like to give some knowledge that I have. Like how weak I give us off. People or people living with dementia. We go through the challenges that we pass in. For example, how to cope up with dementia?

I used to take a rest. My responsibility is to make sure I wake up before she does. I used to sleep very well before and go out, go to schools, go to clubs. I used to party very well, but now I don't do that anymore. I used to drive and just put the car on and go wherever, whenever, wherever I was going. (Pause) I can't hear you. No, nobody is there.

Before going to my job, I ensure he's fine. I provide every basic thing he needs. He's slowed down with his emails, phone calls, voicemails, and I make sure they're all kept in check. I ensure he's using his medication, which are all set before I go to my job. I call at least twice a day to check on him, to make sure he's doing fine, to ensure he's not having any reactions or side effects to the medication, and to make sure he's resting. One should make sure he's doing the little exercise that's been prepared for him. When I'm back, we go for walks, take a stroll around. We do little exercises together. Sometimes we go to church together. He also eats well, eats fruits, and consumes the necessary things. Those on medication, those little exercises, and the hospital visits are also taken care of.

They're fine because they've also sacrificed a lot for me. And so, for the past few weeks, I have made it a habit to do something without seeing it as a chore. That's a hard job, though. There's a lot of challenge, definitely. He forgets things easily and has few reactions. Some things you did yesterday, you can remember some of them. You know, a lot of things, a lot of challenges, but I've learned to just calm down. You know, sometimes when it's overwhelming, I just take a walk. Or just listen to music or just do something to calm myself down because I cannot transfer aggression to him. I cannot show any sign of anger and other things because it would really, really affect his own well-being. So, I rather take a walk or turn on my earbuds and listen to loud music. Or just do something to chill off before I can actually think about what next to do.\\\\n\\\\nSo, I would say I'm really coping nicely and finding strategies to make it much easier for me. So that's how it is.\\\\n\\\\nOK. Well, the relationship with friends, family, and colleagues has definitely shifted. I spend more time at home, apart from my job. Most times, I would love to socialize, you know, visit friends, go to watch a game, go to the club, go to lottery houses, you know.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] I spent most of my free time there. My weekends, you know, I'm socializing. I'm hanging out. I'm doing a lot of stuff. Sports. Now I have to spend time there with my parents, my dad. Because he needs care and everything is getting better, though he needs care. That's affected my relationship with my friends. And well, it makes me and my wife have much more time together since I'm spending more time at home with my father, and she's always around too. So, but with my friends, that's really severed the relationship. We do a lot of call video calls, you know, voice calls to kind of compensate for not being able to show up there. Sometimes, some occasions will clash with the days he has to go to the hospital, and I just have to cancel. The occasion, you know, so it's really done a little to that, my friends, my colleagues, you know, my colleague, maybe. Having a birthday celebration at his home or he's having an occasion, and it clashes with some classes. By the time I have to just be with my dad. So. Most of them do actually understand. They understand my situation, and they don't get annoyed, but definitely, I would say it has really affected me. It has made me more introverted. No staying outdoors. And, just loving things I can do indoors, you know, and I only go out when I have to, apart from my job. Sometimes, I take my dad to see a game because he loves basketball. So, we go to watch some basketball. Sometimes, it makes him happier, makes him livelier.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] You know, you see him celebrating when he sees. Says he, \\\"I hook him.\\\" He goes cold and some other things make him more lively. You know, it adds to making his health better and some other things. So that\\\\'s pretty much how it goes when I go out, and then the relationship with my friends and colleagues has done a little damage to it, definitely. Definitely, it is. It is I who it has stopped. It\\\\'s about where it\\\\'s stopping me from going out and making me spend more time at home, more time with my dad, just ensuring that things are going as they should. But I don\\\\'t see that.\\\\n\\\\nAs you know, when people say barrier, you know it\\\\'s something very negative, something terrible, something you don\\\\'t want. But it is what it is. And now I\\\\'m not seeing it as a barrier. I\\\\'m just saying that\\\\'s how I can describe it as an alternative. You know, I\\\\'m learning a new way of life instead of being the extrovert who talks so much about going out, partying, having so much fun, spending money, wasting money, and wasting time doing other things. Now, I\\\\'m taking all those energies and transferring them into something useful, apart from caregiving. I have some remote things I do, like trading crypto, and I do other things. So I want to say it\\\\'s no longer a barrier. It has taught me how to actually invest in myself and do things while I\\\\'m at home, which also helped me in a way.\\\\n\\\\nOK. Well, in my decision-making process, there\\\\'s no real change, no real change, no real change.', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] Any decision I need to make, in regards to him: Sometimes he's able to make a few decisions, explaining things to him, he doesn't always understand. We write it down or play it slowly and let him greet or listen. If he understands, he can make some decisions. He makes about 50% of decisions, and I make about 50%. Regarding him, there's no change in my decision-making process. I think twice before making any decisions, comparing alternatives, and considering many choices. However, regarding myself and my family, I don't share those decisions with him because he often forgets. For instance, it's your granddaughter's birthday, or it's your grandson's birthday, or it's your wife's birthday, or it's my birthday. We share those with him for the moment. But regarding real issues concerning my decision-making process, I don't share that with him, and there's no change.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] You know, when you say \\\"change in decision-making process,\\\" maybe because I\\\\'m frustrated, I make certain decisions. Or, because I\\\\'m angry, I make certain decisions. I\\\\'ve taught myself to control those, to calm myself down, to think it through, to listen to good music, or do something that helps me relax. When I\\\\'m settled, I can then make a good decision. Decisions made when you\\\\'re annoyed most times are not good, as at that point, you\\\\'re not fully in control of yourself. Such situations can be really terrible and have nasty consequences. I\\\\'ve taught myself how to control them. That\\\\'s definitely true. That\\\\'s definitely true.\\\\n\\\\nCaregiving affects decisions, too. Before I go on any vacation or do anything, I plan it well to ensure it doesn\\\\'t clash with critical hospital visits. I make sure any vacation or something doesn\\\\'t interfere with that.\\\\n\\\\nAs for location, I have a home here, so I don\\\\'t see any circumstances of me moving out of this area for at least the next 10 to 20 years. I\\\\'ve settled in, and I think I\\\\'m doing fine. But,\\\\n\\\\n--End of Response--', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] If there were perhaps a case or any circumstance that would require relocation or movement, I think there would definitely be a barrier. We would have to transfer hospitals and then establish a stable base at the new location. Feed them with all the necessary information and continue doing so there, as this is a significant factor I would consider before making such decisions, which could significantly impact him, such as my going on vacation or relocating somewhere. This is a major function I have to consider.\\\\n\\\\nNow, let's move on to the commitment page. Yes, definitely. Professional commitment, yes. Eversource has indeed affected some things for us.\\\\n\\\\nApril 20, yes. Keep practicing self. Manage daily stress. Describe yourself here, properties, and past weeks. Might the stress of caregiving share strategies?\\\\n\\\\nOK, well, self-care practices. I sometimes find caregiving very frustrating. You know, there are things I tell him that I forget. It can be quite annoying, as even a normal person would get annoyed with some things. I've taught myself to manage these stresses. It wasn't a one-day or two-year job; it's been over seven years now. So, I go for a walk when I'm feeling stressed.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] When I'm feeling stressed, you know, coming home from my full-time job creates a lot of difficulties and problems, and every other thing. And I just want peace. But I'm still dealing with a lot of things, you know, frustration sets in. Terrible mood swings, anger, and every other thing. So I learned to take a walk, you know, not when it's a critical situation where I need to be there. I will just take a walk or go to my music room, put on my earbuds, listen to music or play the piano, or do something that eases my stress. And I just go to the sitting room and watch Netflix. I just laugh, sometimes out loud, and then the stress is away. Some of the strategies I have employed to cope with daily stresses and every other thing are:\\\\n\\\\n1. Taking a walk\\\\n2. Going to the music room\\\\n3. Watching Netflix\\\\n4. Employing strategies to cope with stress\\\\n\\\\nI employ these strategies frequently, about five days a week.\\\\n\\\\nI try to make decisions not to get annoyed. You know, some things are supposed to make you annoyed, and then I just flush out the thought of being annoyed and take it as something normal. So, these are some of the major strategies I have employed as regards coping with daily stresses.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] The five days I received the job offer. Definitely very stressful. Well, I\\\\'d say that\\\\'s about him sticking to his routine. He knows what he should be doing at this time. He knows what he should be doing at that time. And then you ask him, \\\"Have you done this?\\\" \\\"Ohh, I\\\\'ve done it.\\\" But then you find out he hasn\\\\'t, okay. He has a call. He has a check-up call from the hospital while I\\\\'m at my job. And he\\\\'s not answering. He says, \\\"Oh, have you done this?\\\" and then says, \\\"Ohh, I don\\\\'t even know. I should have done that.\\\" You prepare. You want to eat this food and then make it, and then bring it, but he doesn\\\\'t want to eat it anymore. He wants to eat something else. A lot of those things come up. Those are just a few examples, and it\\\\'s very stressful and very annoying. That\\\\'s the fifth one, right? Yeah. Yeah, factors such as professional commitment and financial constraints, yes. Our professional commitment, definitely. There was a time I should have gone. You know, my company was planning to sponsor me on a trip to the United Kingdom for a seminar and some other fellowship, as well as some other knowledge and professional stuffs. It was meant to be a two-week trip. But I found a way to get someone to stay with him, and it all fell apart. I wasn\\\\'t able to go. It was really painful at that moment.', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] At that moment, I had to back out of the opportunity I had been waiting for all my life. It was frustrating and terrible. Well, yes, it is what it is. I have gotten something close, but it doesn't pin me down as much. And when I think of it, I'm supposed to do overtime sometimes just to get some extra cash, but I just can't. I have to dash out of the office on time because I have someone I'm caregiving for. I'm a caregiver, you know. It's really frustrating. And then you get home and meet other stresses and things. It's frustrating. So, professional commitments are a barrier for me, as far as I'm concerned, then financial constraints or health challenges. Well, financial constraints aren't really a problem for me at this moment. I'm above moderate and have a very good salary. My father, you know, he's worked things out for himself. So he has health insurance and other things covered by the job. So I don't really have to worry about financial stuff. It's all available. I wouldn't say financial constraints are a problem. Then there are health changes. Well, I sometimes fall sick and the sick person is still caring for a sick person. So I try my best not to fall sick.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] But when I do well, my wife actually takes the responsibility for doing what I\\\\'ve been doing. So I think that\\\\'s basically it. I get distracted. I get a lot of distraction, a lot, lots of distraction. You know, sometimes he just makes some emergency calls and then you pick up. \\\"What\\\\'s up?\\\" he says, and that would be really annoying. Like you call me five times and just want to hear my voice for what? And then I\\\\'m just, you know, I see your call. I\\\\'m panicking now. Maybe something is wrong and I just have to pick it up. You know, sometimes you see your call. Your brain says, \\\"I\\\\'m busy,\\\" or you just shoot them a text. \\\"I\\\\'m busy. I\\\\'ll call you later.\\\" And then that\\\\'s all.\\\\n\\\\nAnd when you\\\\'re done with your job, you call them. But you see the call. You know, it\\\\'s given for. So you just have to pick it up and then you say, \\\"Ohh, I just want to hear your voice.\\\" Why just want to do this and then you be like, \\\"Don\\\\'t call me.\\\" I have to pick up because of this and that. Don\\\\'t just call, because when I hear my voice, I\\\\'m busy at my job and with other things, and then he doesn\\\\'t hear and he keeps calling. So I get distracted a lot.\\\\n\\\\nBut it\\\\'s part of the job of caregiving, definitely. Well, yes, definitely. There are some positions we want to be promoted to, but it\\\\'s going to hit hard into the time of my caregiving. So I\\\\'ve declined a few of those offers.', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] And then I hope it gets much, much better soon, so I can have fewer hours of care given, and perhaps take some professional promotions. No, I sleep well. I sleep well. He sleeps very well and wakes up early, so I have few issues. At night, I sleep well. For me, or for him? No, no, no, no, none of those.\\\\n\\\\nOkay. And do you sometimes feel concerned about what the future holds for you in this role? Yes, definitely. I definitely think about that. I've brought up that issue in family meetings and other discussions. So, no one is willing to take responsibility. Everyone's busy. Everyone is doing this and that, and it just feels like I have to keep doing this forever. I've declined many professional opportunities. I should have gotten promoted, which is costing me more money and other things. Then, this cake remains a barrier and other obstacles. Thinking about other things, I definitely have thoughts about what the future holds for me in this role. If it continues like this for a long time, I would have declined numerous offers and might still be in the same position for years. I'm hoping very soon that I'll have enough finances.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] We can actually transfer him to a stable, professional home where we have professional caregivers and such. But our greatest hope is that his conditions improve, which would mean fewer hours of caregiving for us. And then, on the days we continue to be caregivers, we'll have fewer hours because he cannot do many things by himself. Doctors assure us that such a possibility is near in the future. We're also hoping that, if that doesn't work out, I won't be considering professional caregiving homes anymore. So that's it about that.\\\\n\\\\nThe truth is, if we could find someone to cover shifts when I'm active for two days a week and he's active for another two days, matching our schedules for another two days, or if I ask for 12 hours a day and he takes the other 12 hours, it would greatly ease my stress and burdens. And then, if we have enough finances, we could move him to a professional place \\u2013 the kind where they don't view it as a task but as their job, having been trained for it. They don't have anything else to stop them from doing their job. I believe those are the two best options.\\\\n\\\\nDefinitely, I think about that solution around 100% of the time.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] First of all, it\\\\'s financial basis, and then we\\\\'ve had a lot of stories about professional caregivers. You know, there have been instances of neglect and terrible happenings. That\\\\'s something he doesn\\\\'t want. He kicks against it. He doesn\\\\'t want it. We\\\\'ve brought up the idea in some meetings where the family is willing to donate and have that done. But he himself doesn\\\\'t want that. He says if we try that and he gets escaped from there, he\\\\'ll run off and do some of those things. You know, it\\\\'s really hard. He doesn\\\\'t want it. And we\\\\'re also concerned about the risk. That\\\\'s why we haven\\\\'t implemented it. He forgets a lot very frequently. Oh, no, he doesn\\\\'t forget me. He knows me, he knows me. But he mostly forgets other family members, not me, not me. And he doesn\\\\'t remember them. Yes, definitely. Like, \\\"What are you?\\\" \\\"What are you looking for?\\\" You know, sometimes it\\\\'s like, \\\"Oh, oh, John, I have a stranger in this house.\\\" It\\\\'s trying to come to the front door, doing this and that. You\\\\'ve had calls like that when my wife was back at her job, and he called me up. \\\"Oh John, I have this woman, a lady at my door. I don\\\\'t know what she\\\\'s looking for. Can you call the cops? Can you do this?\\\" And I\\\\'m like, \\\"It\\\\'s my wife for God\\\\'s sake.\\\" So you have issues like that, but he\\\\'s not aggressive towards them. He just wants to know who is who and what is what. And I\\\\'m sure he\\\\'s safe. I would say he\\\\'s progressing towards neutral.', '\\\\n  [/INST] \\\"Yeah. I don\\\\'t read it; I\\\\'ll read it. Well, I feel I might share my experiences, and I was thinking of possibly sharing some resources that can help me on my caregiving journey. Maybe we can discuss such things during the meeting.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n--End of Response--']\",\n          \"['\\\\n  [/INST] \\\"Yeah. Can I read the questions first? OK. Uh, my name is Denmark. OK, you can call me Palma. I can call you then. And, but my real names are Denmark; my parents named me that, from the disease. I\\\\'m 25 years old. Yes. My audio lets me put it on. Turn on the headphones. OK. Just a minute. Now, are you hearing me? Yeah. I can now speak a few words, then it begins shaking. Can you? Just send me the script. Let me use the headphone microphone and the artificial microphone on the side. I think that will be very helpful. OK. Can you hear me that way? Yeah. My loved one is 62 years old. And he told me that I began, like, many years ago. I wasn\\\\'t aware, but I came to realize, about five years ago, that I began my journey to become a giver. Him. We have to go to the hospital like twice a month. There\\\\'s a principal description of the doctor and the amount of clinical trials. Twice a month, we visit the hospital. And we have some dose like that for him? Which is given, yeah. Most of the time, I\\\\'m the one who is with him because of my job. But sometimes, my brother takes care of him instead. Doing.\\\"', '\\\\n  [/INST] Uh, let me read the question and answer. Another question I can answer. I can answer questions like yours. About two people, to them. A person may act insensitively, even if they like you, such as your father. The main role is as if you have taken it upon yourself, and it is a new and familiar job to you. Be ready for it. There were positive moments, not that many, but I can recall having one or two stories to tell daily. Going to the game just to play some games. Yes, any question. For example, the second question. Like, for instance, have to go out, such as with my friends sometimes. I sometimes have to cancel going out, for example, to the clubs at night. You see, I have cancelled those because I have someone to take care of and be with him around. This is also very challenging. Like you have to break some relationships, for instance, those friends that you cannot understand making such statements.', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] Like you aren't cooperating with them, as you aren't with them sometimes. See. It's like it's very hard. Like there was a time to go to the IT was Christmas. We were planning to go on a tour with my friends. My friend and I had to cancel everything. Also, there is a time like it's not a job shift. I had to talk with my boss to stay with my father. Not yet. Yeah, like for example, it's sometimes very hard to like. You have to like a very big barrier, you don't just go, you have to fix your schedule. You have to have a consistent routine for me. I have to wait for my brother when he's on. So that's when I can have some time to go out. For instance, like for example, myself, I have a friend who usually comes to our house. At our house, we stay with him to get stories. You see, it's like a supportive friend. We can say that he's very supportive to me. He's been there for me. Like when I need him, he's usually there for me. Let me ask you a question. OK, OK. I've understood the question. Yeah. I can't say yes. You see, for instance, my head was having to relocate to the UK. I'm now clear. Can you hear me now? Yes. Now I'm shaking. No. I'm just sitting in my room, maybe I'm just thinking. Can you hear me now? No, I'm using my desktop's microphone. I was saying those are the times. Yes. Yes, I'm sorry.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] Sample at this time I wanted to move to the UK. Recently, but I had changed my decision. Because of being a caregiver, I had to like to change everything. Every decision that you have to make, you just have to be a caregiver. Very well. To be here? Yeah. To make this an environment, to make him feel better. I can\\\\'t see that. That I will have to make my decisions anyhow. I have to have, like a Conservative asked, \\\"Like uh, I can answer this way this question for like, uh, in the past few weeks.\\\" Like me, myself and mom, I like gaming. And also, one of the ways I can cope up with managing daily stress is by playing computer games like FIFA. Or, when my friends come, we stay with him. It\\\\'s one of my stress managing factors strategies. But, like daily, please. You see, for example, my father is someone you have to cope up with. Do what he says, you have to with his decisions, for example, when maybe he wants to lie on a mattress. There\\\\'s no other way. You can say that. You\\\\'ll have to have your decision to have another decision. That\\\\'s quite challenging.', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] But stress and stress is something very common in giving a job. And it's very. Hey. Click. So if you don't have a way to manage tests effectively, and I'm just like myself, I can just tell you, for example, to have something you find yourself doing when you're not very busy. You just find yourself keeping yourself busy, for instance. Yeah. And I can say, if they have financial constraints in the past few weeks, but we had Medicare insurance for us. Was it they had? Yeah. For our sake. And you know, for example, you have to take a person through clinical trials and buy expensive drugs. You have to control the person if you're not very busy. It will be very, very hard. Also, I can say that there are very few professionals who deal with this disease. So you have to have a timetable with a professional or have your own personal one. Otherwise, you'll have a hard time for yourself. Yes. Yeah, it's very hard to balance, for example. Like myself, I'm a software engineer. I'm a freelance software engineer. So, for example, I have a client, and I actually have to set a timetable for him. I cannot tell him I'm not free tomorrow. I have to be free first. So, I have to be free first.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] Then I make a timetable for us to agree so we can meet. -- Agree on a timetable so we can meet.\\\\n\\\\nYes.

Very many have changed. -- Now, very many things have changed. Not one or two, but many have changed.\\\\n\\\\nYeah, yeah. The future? I can maybe become: a college student, to become a doctor; a professional caregiver for 12 people with dementia. -- The future?

Just they can just say, \\\"For example, you can just...\\\" They are giving journey into caregiving. Like for example, you can say, \\\"Good care. Give us, for instance, knowledge that people have, for example, about dementia, how to relieve their stress, how to feed them, like how to give them good medicines.\\\" See, I think that resource would be helpful to many people around the world, not only in the US. And just say, \\\"It\\\\'s unfamiliar and. It can save some.\\\" It\\\\'s a new and unfamiliar role, but you just have to. Yes, I can say, \\\"Caregiving is a challenging job.\\\" Yes. It was through this app, called Reddit. Myself, I decided to participate in this research to help, for instance, impart some knowledge that I have. Like, for example, I give off weakness to people or people living with dementia. We go through the challenges that we face. For example, how do we cope with dementia? Yes.']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It has been a negative life for me that's reduced my parting, my, my, my studies, everything about me. So it has been a difficult life life for me. Going to parties. I'm going to school too. I have stopped schools and I have been taking care of my mother. I have stopped school. There is no positive moment. In financial aspects, I don't have any money to take care of her again.

Describe, OK, giving assisting you about well-being the past few weeks. Regarding your relationship with family, friends, or comics to the Internet, changes or shifts. Relationships. The question too I have not. I have not noticed any changes. It has been the way I have been given my life for the past five years. Yep. My family and friends have run away because I'm taking care of my mother. So I'm I'm the only one with her now. No, no, no, no. Sorry, I can't hear you. No, it doesn't affect me. Oh. My communication, my communication and my attention has been shot with my family and friends. My colleagues in the world in the school too. I invite only one of my friends has told by me for the past four years. Five years. So even if I should call her, call her, she will take like two to three days before she come to me. Yes, yes. I can't hear you please. Please repeat. I can't hear you. Yes. Sorry, question 3, right? My family, I I told you the other time. But my family and friends are no more. They have. They have gone. They left me alone. It's only one of my friends that stay with me. Whenever I call her. She used to take three to four days to come. OK. Over the past few weeks, have you and the kids are not engineers intention making process. You. Yes please. My decision making has changed. Due to the food I eat at home. Financial everything. Because of the of my mother's sickness. Yes, yes, I do think about her. I have to put her into consideration first. Number four question, describe your self-care practices in the past few weeks to manage the daily stresses of caregiving, share your strategy strategies that have been particularly helpful in coping with the steady stress of caregiving. OK, #1. The time I cook for her. Time I do, I do take care of her. Time of caring, time of management. Time of making her happy. That's OK, then that's what I can say for that number four question please. I go on social media. Will I surf the Internet? To rest, I used to rest. Whenever I take care of us and I. Whenever she is asleep, I used to sleep too. I used to take a rest. My make sure I wake up before. I used to sleep very well before and go out, go to schools, go to clubs. I used to party very well, but now I don't used to do that again. I used to drive I I will put on a car and drive out wherever, whenever, wherever I'm going. Sorry, I can't hear you. No, nobody either. It's to go out. I don't used to leave her at home and go out. I go with. I go out with her, I'll put her inside the car and go out. Nobody to stay with her. In the past few weeks of earning factors such as professional commitment, financial constraints for health challenges influence how you fees, and based on this. These special therapists are attention caregiver used to allow her to allow the person to come, but now there is no financial support again from anybody. So I had to go and. I had to carry out to the government hospital for caring. Yes, there is no changes cause I don't have any money. I'm not. I'm not financially buoyant now. Sorry, I can't hear. Yes, I can't hear you. Fair enough. I'm I'm fair enough. Fair enough. Health my isn't my home or my mother's health. My health. At least I'm copying a little. I get tired. Stress is too much for me. I get tired every now and then. I'm because I'm taking care of my mother because I'm I'm a caregiver to my mother. I've not seen any support from anyone. I work remotely. And just work for three hours and remaining hours is for taking care of her. No, he's answer my mother. I'm doing it because of my mother. I'll just make sure that I have given her her drugs, her food, and then I'll start working. It has reduced my wages. Like. Like 2 weeks ago now when I was working she she was awake. I had to stop the work when I was what? What? I had to stop what I was doing then attended. Attend to her. And this has. Affected me in a lot of ways. What do I do? Ah, I used to give her more than. More than 10 hours. As a key given, do you sometimes feel concerned about what the future holds for you in that room? If so, could you share more about it? What kind of help or support will bear for you? The Economist question as a caregiver, do you sometimes feel concerned about the future? What the future holds for you in that? If so, yes, yes, yes, because I need a partner. I will still have, I'll, I'm going to give birth, have my husband and get married one day. So I need an assistant. I need a partner too. Yes. No, no, no, no. No. Please repeat the question. I can't hear you. Yes. Yes, I'm here. I'm here. I need to dedicate my time to her. The voting of attention to. And financial support. I can't remember, not really. I can't remember anything now. Like the moment I I went to go and look for some jobs to do. And she needs my attention. So I had to attend to her before going. She can Remember Me. I show her some old videos of ours, some pictures and lots more. She she react amazingly. She goes into her room when someone. Comes in. As in she as she reacts amazingly, sometimes not every time. No, no, no, she doesn't. No, she remembers me. No, no, no. I don't used to allow her to go outside alone. Two times in a week. No, no, not him. Stressful.\",\n          \"OK, my name is. Yeah. My name is John Smith. I am 26 years old and I am a child to the, you know, the person with dementia. Is my father, OK? And I'm the only one who is the major caregiver. OK, answering question one well. For the past few weeks. Yeah, it's about 7 years, 7 to 8 years. He's 57. Why so? Weak. Yeah, I'm. I'm always with him. He stays with me. We stay together. So before going to my job, I ensure he's fine. I provide every basic things he needs. You know he slowed his, his emails, his phone calls, voicemails he has, and sure everything are kept in check. And sure, he's using his medication. They are all set before I go to my job at my job. I always calling I calling at least twice. To check on him to make sure he's doing fine, make sure he's not having any reaction or side effects to the medication. Make sure he's resting. One is supposed to make sure he's doing the little exercise that has been prepared for him. You know when I'm back. Also, I take him, we go for a walk, take a stroll around. We do little exercise. Sometimes we go to church together. There. And sure, he also eats well, eat fruits, eats the necessary things. Those use medication, those little exercise, then also on the days of his visit to the hospital. And sure, I take him there on time. I'm always saying while he's in the. Doctor. We are done, you know, come back home. So it's just like a normal thing you do for your child. So it I immediately I'm responsible for most of the things. OK, someone says that. OK, well, for the past few weeks I would say the pressure is much more lesser than before. Then I had you know, when we first started, it was a lot for me to taking balancing being a caregiver and also having a full time job. It's really, really tough. It's really tough. And then being at an entry level, someone with little or no, you know superiority, I have buses, which I'm also under their command. You know, it's really hard to have my wish in time like that. So then also it's it's always very difficult coping with the new development. You know things your father can do before easily before you find it. You say that he's having a hard time doing them and you always just have to be around and ensuring that it does it right. So it's always very tough to take in. It's really hard to believe that this is happening. So for for the past few weeks. Ice after that I'm finding it a little bit more easier because I've let it become part of me. I've let it become something I do, you know, not because I want to receive an award for some, you know, some people work because they just want to get a pay. Some people do some things because they just want to, you know, receive profits from it. But when you do something because of the. All of you have for the person. You don't count it as something that, even if it's not reciprocated. Well, you don't see it as anything, so I've learned to teach myself to do it because I love my father and my parents and I would. I'm willing to go extra mile to make sure they're OK. They're fine because they've also sacrificed a lot for me. And so for the past few weeks, I have made it my habits, you know, something I do without being for something I do without seeing it. That's a hard job, though. There's a lot of challenge, definitely a lot of challenge. Tell him something. He forgets it easily has few reactions. Some things you did yesterday. You can remember some things. You know, a lot of things, a lot of challenges, but I've learned to just calm down. You know, sometimes when it's overwhelming, I just take a. Walk. Or just listen to music or just do something to calm me myself down because I cannot be transferring aggression to him. I cannot show any sign of no anger and any other things because. It would really, really affect his own well-being, so I rather would rather take a walk on his throat, or rather just turn my earbuds on and listen to loud music. Or. Just do something to just chill off before I can actually think on what next to. Do. So I would say I'm really coping nicely and I'm finding strategies to make it much more easier for me. So that's how that is. OK. Well, relationship with friends, family and colleagues definitely there is a shift. I spend more time at home. Apart from my job, apart from my job, you know most times then I would love to socialize, you know, visit friends, go to watch a game, go to at the club, go to lottery houses, you know. I spent my most of my free times there. My weekends, you know, I'm socializing. I'm hanging out. I'm doing a lot of stuff. Sports. Now I have to spend there with my parents, my. Dad. Because he needs the care and everything is getting better though, but he needs the care so. That's affected my relationship with my friends. And well, it makes me and my wife have much more time together since I'm spending more time at home with my father and she's always around too. So but with my friends, that's really severed relationship. We do a lot of call video calls, you know, voice calls to kind of compensate for. May not being able to show up there. Sometimes that some occasions will clash with the days he has to go to the hospital and I just have to. Cancel. The occasion, you know, so it's really done a little to that, my friends, my colleagues, you know, my colleague, maybe. Having a birthday celebration at his home or he's having an occasion and it's classes with sometime. By the time I have to just be. With my dad. So. Most of them do actually understand. They understand my situation and they don't get annoyed, but definitely I would say it has really affected it has made me more introvert. No staying indoors. And. Just loving things I can do indoors, you know, and I only go out when I have to. Apart from my job. Sometimes I take. My dad also sees to see a game because he loves basketball. So we go to watch some basketball. Sometimes makes him more happy, makes him lively. You know, you see him celebrate him when he sees. Says he hook. He goes cold and some other things makes him more lively, you know, it adds makes health better and some other things. So that's pretty much how when I go out and then the relationship with my friends and colleagues, it has done a little damage to it, definitely. Definitely it is. It is I it has. It is about where it's stopping me from going out and it's making me spend more time at home, spend more time with my dad, just ensuring that. Things are going as it should so, but I don't see that. As you know, when you people say barrier, you know it's something very negative, something terrible, something you don't want to, but it is what it is. And now I'm not seeing it as a barrier. I'm just saying that is that how can I describe it as an alternative? You know, I'm learning a new way of life instead of being that you know. Extroverts talk so much going out, partying, having so much fun, spending money, wasting money and wasting time doing some other. Things. I now taking all those energies and transfer it into something useful apart from while I'm even caregiving, I have some remote things I do I trade crypto, I do some other things, so I want to say it's a barrier anymore. It has taught me how to actually invest in myself and do things while I'm at home, so that also helped me in a way. OK. Well, in my decision making process, I think. No real change, no real change, no real change. Any decision I need to make, you know, in regards. To. Him. Sometimes he actually is able to make few decisions, sometimes you know, explaining some things to him he doesn't understand. We write it down and let him greet, or we play it and let him listen to it very slowly. And then if he understands, he can make some decisions. He makes about 50% of decisions and I make about 50. So in regards to him, I don't think there is any change in my decision making process and then it's more than fine. I think twice before I make any decisions, I compare my alternatives. I consider a lot of choices before I can actually make a decision, but as regards myself well, some decisions I make as regards my own life. I shared this with my wife. There's no real need of sharing with my dad, because even if I shared with him before tomorrow, he forgets or something like that. So my decisions as regards myself, my family, I don't really share them with him because he don't really are remembers most of those things and the few ones that actually you know like maybe. Ah ohh. It's your granddaughter birthday. Or it's your grandson's birthday or something like that. Ohh it's your. It's your wife's birthday or it's my birthday. You know, things like that. That they're just for the moment. So we share those with him. But you know, real issues as regarding my decision making process. I don't share that. With him and. There is no change. You know when you say change in decision making process, maybe because I'm frustrated. I make certain decisions or because I'm angry, I make certain decisions I've taught myself so much to be able to control all those, calm myself down, take it through, listen to good music, do something that just, you know, it's a little stressful now. Then when I'm come, when I'm settled, I can now think my. Way out of making a very good decision because when you make decisions when you are annoyed most times it is end of the time. There are no good decisions because at that point I won't say you've lost your mind, but you are totally out. Of yourself and. Such situation might be really, really terrible and have nasty consequences, so I've taught myself how. To control them. Yeah, that that is definitely true. That's definitely true. Caregiving. Yes, definitely, it does affect it affects those decisions. You know, I, before I go for any vacation of stuff, I have to plan it very well and it sure it doesn't clash with you stuffs, especially critical visits to the hospitals. The. So I make sure any vacation or something doesn't tamper with that. Well about location, I have a home here, so I don't see any circumstance of me, you know, moving out of this area for at least for the next 1020 years. So I love this place. I settled in and I think I'm doing fine. So but. If there would be maybe a case or maybe any circumstance that would actually need the relocation or movement, I think there even would definitely be a barrier because we have to actually transfer hospitals and then get a stable around the place where we are. And feed them with all the previous information they need to know and then continue doing it there, because it definitely is a factor I would consider before I make such kinds of huge decisions, you know, decisions that would really affect him, like me going on vacation or locating or going for holidays somewhere or something. It is a. Major function that I have to consider. OK, now commitment page. Yeah, definitely. Professional commitment, yes. And Eversource definitely, they have affected some things with us. 04/20 OK yeah, self keep practicing. Yeah, manage daily stress. Describe yourself here, properties and past weeks. Might the stress of caregiving share strategies? OK, well, self-care practices. Like I said, sometimes it gets very frustrating. You know, sometimes some things you tell him you forget. It's really annoying because sometimes it's annoying. Definitely any normal person will get annoyed with some things. Like I said in previous recordings I have taught myself to manage these stresses. It wasn't a day's job or two years job or three years. Job. It's been over 7 years now. So. I go for a walk when I'm having. When I'm feeling stress, you know, having gone to my full time job makes a lot of difficulties and stuffs problems and every other thing. And I'm coming back and then I just want peace. Then I'm still having a lot of things to deal with, you know, frustration sets in. Terrible mood swings, anger and every other thing. So I learned to take a walk, you know, once it's not that it's in a critical situation where I need to be there. I will just take a walk or I just go to my music room, put on my earbuds, listen to music or play the piano, or do something that would ease my stress. And I just even go to sitting room and just watch Netflix. And just laugh, laugh out sometimes and then. Is the stress away, so some of the strategies have actually been employing and sure I go away from that. You know, I I go away from where he is and just try to ease the with the stress and then. And then sometimes. And then sometimes. I just you know. I just try to cope with it. I makes the decisions not to get annoyed. You know, some things are supposed to make you annoyed and then. To see. Why am I? Why am I? Why am I even getting annoyed for no reason? Listen, isn't something much that should get me annoyed? And then I just flush out the thought of being annoyed and then take it as something normal. So. I think those are some of the major strategies I have employed as regards coping with daily stresses and every other stuff. How frequently? I'll say 5, I'll say majorly five days a week. The five days I got my job. Definitely very stressful. Well. I would say is about him keeping to his routine. He knows what he should be doing at this time. He knows what he should be doing at that time. And then you ask him, have you done this? Ohh, I've done it. Then you find out he's not done it, OK. He has a call. He has a check up call from the hospital while I'm at my job. And he's not. He's not picking them up. He's not answering. And he say, oh, have you done this and say ohh, I don't even know. That I should. Have done that and then you prepare. You want to eat this food and then you make it and then you bring it and he doesn't want to eat it anymore. He wants to eat something else. You know, a lot of those things come up. Those are just a few of the examples and it's very stressful and very annoying. That's the fifth one, right? Yeah. Yeah, factors such as professional commitment, financial constraints, yes. Our professional commitment definitely you know there was a time I should. You know have. I my company was planning to actually sponsor me on a trip to, I think to the United Kingdom you. Know. For a seminar and some other fellowship, and then for some other knowledge and professional stuffs, it was meant to be two weeks. And then I found a way to get someone to stay with him and every other thing, and it just fell apart and I wasn't able to go. It was really painful at that moment. At that moment, I, you know, just had to back out of the opportunity that I had been waiting all my life. For. And then. It was frustrating and terrible. Well, yeah, it is what it is. I have gotten something close. That now so it doesn't pin me so much. And when I think of it so a lot of professional commitments, you know, sometimes I am supposed to do over some over time just to get some extra cash and then I just can't, I just have to be dashing out of the office money time because I have someone. I'm caregiving you. Know. It's really, really frustrating. And then you get home. And you meet some other stress and some other. Things. Frustrating. So I would say professional commitment. Care given standards, A barrier between a lot of professional commitments as far as I'm concerned, then financial constraints or health challenges, well, financial constraints for me at this moment. Well, I thank God, I think I'm I'm I'm above moderate and in a very good salary. My father also you know he's worked some things down for himself. So he has his health insurance and some other things that basically covered by the job and things he has done while he was still active. So I don't really have support and care about financial stuff. It is well available. So I won't say financial constraints is really any problem. Then health changes. Well, sometimes I also fall sick and then the sick person still caring for a sick person. So I try my as best as much as I as I can not to. Fall sick. But when I do I well, my wife actually takes the. Takes the responsibility of. Doing what I've been doing, so I think that's basically it. I get distracted. Get a lot of distraction, a lot, lots of distraction. You know, sometimes he just makes some emergency call and then you pick up and you be like, what's up? And says, I just want to hear your voice. You know, and that would be really annoying. Like you call me five times and just want to hear my voice for what? And then I'm just, you know, I see your call. I'm panicking now. Maybe something is wrong and I just have to pick it up. You know, sometimes you see your. Call. You know my brain and say, oh, I'm busy or you just shoot them a text. I'm busy. I'll call you later. And then that's all. And when you are done with job, you call them. But you see the call, you know. It you know, is someone OK given for. So you just have to pick it up and then you say ohh I just want to hear your voice. Why just want to do this and then you be like don't call. Me like this when I see your call. I have to pick up because. Of this and that don't just call, because when I hear my voice, I'm busy at my job and some other things, and then he doesn't hear and he keeps calling. So I get distracted a lot. So, but it's part of the job of caregiving, definitely. Well, yes, definitely. There are some positions I want us to be promoted to, but it's going to definitely hit hit into the time of my care given. So I've declined few of those offers. And then I hope it gets very, very much more better soon then I can have less hours care given and then maybe take some professional, you know promotions. No, I sleep well. I sleep well. Eat good. He sleeps very. He sleeps very early and he wakes up late, so I hardly have any issues. At night I sleep well. For me or for him? No, no, no, no, none of those. OK. And do you sometimes feel concerned about what the future holds for you in the room? Yeah, definitely. I definitely think about that. I definitely think about that. I've table that, you know, in the family meetings and some other stuff. So, you know, no one is willing to take responsibility. Everyone's busy. Everyone is doing this and that and it just feels. Like I just have to keep doing this forever and then I think that, well, I've actually declined a lot of professional things. I should have, you know, gotten promoted and getting costing me more money, getting me, you know, some other things and. Then. This cake even is staying as a barrier and some other things and. You know, just thinking about some other things. So I definitely have the thoughts most of the time what the future holds for me in this role because if it continues like this for a long time, you know I would have. To decline a. Lot. Of offers along the line, and I might still be in the same. Position for years, so I consider that and then I'm hoping very soon that one actually have enough finances. We can actually transfer him to a stable, you know, professional home where we have professional caregivers and stuff like that. But the utmost prayer is that his conditions improve, and then we actually have less hours of caregiving. And then. We are still caregivers that day, but we have less hours because he cannot do many things by himself. Well, doctors are promised that that is a possibility in the nearest future. We are also hoping that God, if that is possible, but if that doesn't work out, then at some point I. Won't. Be considering I would be considering. Professional caregiving homes. So I guess that's it about that. Well, the truth is, if I have someone, someone else, if we can run something like a shift when I'm active for these two days a week and then he's active for another two days and match for another two days, or I'm asking for 12 hours a day and then he takes the other 12 hours. You know, something like that, it would ease me of a lot of stress, a lot of burdens. And then. If possibly if we have enough finances and we can just move him to a professional place, you know those ones, they don't see it as a task. They've been trained for that and then they do it to any living. So that's their job. They don't have something else. To stop. In them so. I think those might be the two great options. OK. Yeah, definitely, definitely. I think about that by the percent of the time. First of all, it's financial basis and then also we've had a lot of stories about professional caregivers, you know, neglect and terrible happenings that we've had. That doesn't want he he he kicks, he kicks against it. He doesn't want it. We've actually brought up in some meetings where the family is willing to donate and then get that done. But he himself doesn't want that. He says if we try that and he gets escaped from there, he's gonna run off and do some of that stuffs. You know, it's really hard. He doesn't want it. And then we also we are concerned about the risk. So that's why we're not really implemented. He forgets a lot very frequently. Ohh me. No, he doesn't forget me. He doesn't forget me. He knows me, he knows me. Mostly forget some other family members, but not not me, not me. And doesn't remember them. Yeah, definitely. Like, oh, what are you? What are you looking for? You know sometimes like, oh, oh, John, I have a stranger in this house. It's trying to come to the front door doing this and that, you know, I've had calls like that when my wife, you know, my wife was back at her job and then he called me up. Ohh John, I have this a woman, a lady at my door. I don't know what she's looking for. Can you call the cops? Can you do this? And I'm like it's my wife for God's. Sake. So you have issues like that so, but he's not aggressive towards them. He just wants to know who is who and what is what. And I'm sure he's safe. I would say progressive. Out to neutral. Yeah. So I don't read it, read it. Well, I feel I might share my experiences and then I was thinking maybe there are some resources that can actually help me caregiving journey, maybe something like that would also be shared during the meeting. So those are the things. I'm looking for.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"corrected_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 65,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[\\\"\\\\n  [/INST] I'm Alexia. Bonnie. I'm 28 years old. Single. I live with my parents. I stay with my parents, as I do who I am. I give care to them, very well. I am the only caregiver for my mother, who is 56 years old. It's been five years since I've been caring for her.\\\\n\\\\nShare how you have been feeling in the past few weeks while taking care of your loved one with dementia. Tell us about any moment, whether positive or challenging, that stands out to you. It's been a difficult life for me, reducing my participation in studies and other aspects of my life. So the past few weeks have been a challenging time for me.\\\\n\\\\nGoing to parties and school are things I've had to stop. I've stopped going to school to take care of my mother. No positive moments stand out.\\\\n\\\\nIn financial aspects, I don't have any money to continue taking care of her. Cooking for her can be difficult, as she often screams, shouts, and yells. I leave her care to my meter when I can.\\\\n\\\\nRegarding your relationships with family, friends, or anyone online, have there been any changes or shifts? I haven't noticed any changes. My life has been this way for the past five years.\\\\n\\\\nMy family and friends have distanced themselves because I'm taking care of my mother. I'm the only one with her now. No, it doesn't affect me.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] My communication and attention have been divided among my family and friends, as well as my colleagues at school. I've only managed to invite one friend to join me for the past four to five years. Even when I call her, it takes her two to three days to respond. I'm having trouble hearing you. Could you please repeat? I can't hear you. Yes, I believe that's question 3.\\\\n\\\\nMy family and I discussed the other time that my family and friends are no longer with me. They have left me alone. Only one friend remains with whom I can call. She used to take three to four days to come when I called.\\\\n\\\\nOver the past few weeks, you and the kids have not been involved in the engineering process intentionally. I've made some changes in my decision-making process. This is due to the food I eat at home and the financial situation, as well as my mother's sickness. I often think about her and prioritize her needs first.\\\\n\\\\nRegarding question 4, I'd be happy to describe my self-care practices over the past few weeks to manage the daily stresses of caregiving. My strategies for coping with the steady stress of caregiving include:\\\\n\\\\n1. The time I spend cooking for her and taking care of her. This time is dedicated to her care, management, and making her happy.\\\\n2. I engage in social media and surf the internet as a means of rest.\\\\n\\\\n(Note: The original text did not contain a clear question or prompt for response, so I assumed the response should address the general topic of self-care practices and coping strategies for caregiving.)\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] Whenever I take care of us, and I, whenever she is asleep, I used to sleep too. I used to take a rest. My responsibility is to make sure I wake up before she does. I used to sleep very well before and go out, go to schools, go to clubs. I used to party very well, but now I don't do that anymore. I used to drive and just put the car on and go wherever, whenever, wherever I was going. (Pause) I can't hear you. No, nobody is there. It's to go out. I didn't used to leave her at home and go out. I go out with her now. I'll put her inside the car and go out. Nobody is there to stay with her.\\\\n\\\\nIn the past few weeks, earning factors such as professional commitment, financial constraints, and health challenges have influenced how I manage my fees. Based on this, these special therapists used to allow her to come, but now there is no financial support from anyone. So, I had to go and carry out my caregiving duties at the government hospital. (Pause) Yes, there have been no changes because I don't have any money. I'm not financially buoyant now. (Pause) I can't hear you.\\\\n\\\\nYes, my health isn't my home or my mother's health. My health is a concern for me. At least I'm coping a little. I get tired. Stress is too much for me. I get tired every now and then. I'm a caregiver to my mother because I take care of her. I've not seen any support from anyone. I work remotely.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] And I work for her for three hours, and the remaining hours are for taking care of her. No, she's not the one answering me. I'm doing it because of my mother. I'll just make sure that I have given her her drugs, her food, and then I'll start working. It has reduced my wages.\\\\n\\\\nLike, two weeks ago, when I was working, she was awake. I had to stop what I was doing then and attend to her. This has affected me in a lot of ways. What do I do? Ah, I used to give her more than ten hours of care. As a caregiver, do you sometimes feel concerned about what the future holds for you in that role? If so, could you share more about it? What kind of help or support will you need?\\\\n\\\\nThe Economist asks, as a caregiver, do you sometimes feel concerned about the future? What does the future hold for you in that role? If so, yes, because I need a partner. I will still have my husband and get married one day. So I need an assistant. I need a partner too. Yes. No, no, no, no. No.\\\\n\\\\nPlease repeat the question. I can't hear you. Yes. Yes, I'm here. I'm here. I need to dedicate my time to her. I require both her attention and financial support. I can't remember, not really. I can't remember anything now. Like the moment I went to look for some jobs to do, and she needed my attention. So I had to attend to her before going. She can remember me. I show her some old videos of ours, some pictures, and lots more.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] She reacts amazingly. She goes into her room when someone comes in. As she reacts amazingly, sometimes, not every time. No, she doesn't react that way. No, she remembers me. No, she didn't used to allow him to go outside alone, but she did it two times a week. No, it's not him. Stressful.\\\"]\",\n          \"[\\\"\\\\n  [/INST] My name is John Smith. I'm 26 years old. I'm the only child of a person with dementia. Is my father? I'm the major caregiver. I've been doing well with answering question one for the past few weeks, for about 7 to 8 years. He's 57. Why is he this way? It's weak. I'm always with him. He stays with me. We stay together. Before going to my job, I ensure he's fine. I provide every basic thing he needs. He's slowed down with his emails, phone calls, voicemails, and I make sure they're all kept in check. I ensure he's using his medication, which are all set before I go to my job. I call at least twice a day to check on him, to make sure he's doing fine, to ensure he's not having any reactions or side effects to the medication, and to make sure he's resting. One should make sure he's doing the little exercise that's been prepared for him. When I'm back, we go for walks, take a stroll around. We do little exercises together. Sometimes we go to church together. He also eats well, eats fruits, and consumes the necessary things. Those on medication, those little exercises, and the hospital visits are also taken care of. I take him to the hospital on time. It's just like taking care of a normal child. I'm immediately responsible for most of the things.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] \\\"OK, someone says that. Well, for the past few weeks, I would say the pressure is much less than before. I had to acknowledge, when we first started, it was a lot for me to balance being a caregiver and having a full-time job. It\\\\'s really tough. It\\\\'s really tough. And then, being at an entry level, with little or no superiority, I have buses to contend with, which I\\\\'m also under their command. It\\\\'s really hard for me to have my wishes met in a timely manner. So, it\\\\'s always very difficult to cope with new developments. You know, things your father could do before easily, you find him having a hard time doing them, and you always have to be around and ensure that they\\\\'re done right. It\\\\'s always very tough to take in. It\\\\'s really hard to believe that this is happening. So, for the past few weeks, I\\\\'ve found it a little bit easier because I\\\\'ve let it become a part of me. I\\\\'ve let it become something I do, not because I want to receive an award or profits from it, but because I love my father and parents, and I would.\\\"', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] I'm willing to go the extra mile to make sure they're okay. They're fine because they've also sacrificed a lot for me. And so, for the past few weeks, I have made it a habit to do something without seeing it as a chore. That's a hard job, though. There's a lot of challenge, definitely. He forgets things easily and has few reactions. Some things you did yesterday, you can remember some of them. You know, a lot of things, a lot of challenges, but I've learned to just calm down. You know, sometimes when it's overwhelming, I just take a walk. Or just listen to music or just do something to calm myself down because I cannot transfer aggression to him. I cannot show any sign of anger and other things because it would really, really affect his own well-being. So, I rather take a walk or turn on my earbuds and listen to loud music. Or just do something to chill off before I can actually think about what next to do.\\\\n\\\\nSo, I would say I'm really coping nicely and finding strategies to make it much easier for me. So that's how it is.\\\\n\\\\nOK. Well, the relationship with friends, family, and colleagues has definitely shifted. I spend more time at home, apart from my job. Most times, I would love to socialize, you know, visit friends, go to watch a game, go to the club, go to lottery houses, you know.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] I spent most of my free time there. My weekends, you know, I'm socializing. I'm hanging out. I'm doing a lot of stuff. Sports. Now I have to spend time there with my parents, my dad. Because he needs care and everything is getting better, though he needs care. That's affected my relationship with my friends. And well, it makes me and my wife have much more time together since I'm spending more time at home with my father, and she's always around too. So, but with my friends, that's really severed the relationship. We do a lot of call video calls, you know, voice calls to kind of compensate for not being able to show up there. Sometimes, some occasions will clash with the days he has to go to the hospital, and I just have to cancel. The occasion, you know, so it's really done a little to that, my friends, my colleagues, you know, my colleague, maybe. Having a birthday celebration at his home or he's having an occasion, and it clashes with some classes. By the time I have to just be with my dad. So. Most of them do actually understand. They understand my situation, and they don't get annoyed, but definitely, I would say it has really affected me. It has made me more introverted. No staying outdoors. And, just loving things I can do indoors, you know, and I only go out when I have to, apart from my job. Sometimes, I take my dad to see a game because he loves basketball. So, we go to watch some basketball. Sometimes, it makes him happier, makes him livelier.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] You know, you see him celebrating when he sees. Says he, \\\"I hook him.\\\" He goes cold and some other things make him more lively. You know, it adds to making his health better and some other things. So that\\\\'s pretty much how it goes when I go out, and then the relationship with my friends and colleagues has done a little damage to it, definitely. Definitely, it is. It is I who it has stopped. It\\\\'s about where it\\\\'s stopping me from going out and making me spend more time at home, more time with my dad, just ensuring that things are going as they should. But I don\\\\'t see that.\\\\n\\\\nAs you know, when people say barrier, you know it\\\\'s something very negative, something terrible, something you don\\\\'t want. But it is what it is. And now I\\\\'m not seeing it as a barrier. I\\\\'m just saying that\\\\'s how I can describe it as an alternative. You know, I\\\\'m learning a new way of life instead of being the extrovert who talks so much about going out, partying, having so much fun, spending money, wasting money, and wasting time doing other things. Now, I\\\\'m taking all those energies and transferring them into something useful, apart from caregiving. I have some remote things I do, like trading crypto, and I do other things. So I want to say it\\\\'s no longer a barrier. It has taught me how to actually invest in myself and do things while I\\\\'m at home, which also helped me in a way.\\\\n\\\\nOK. Well, in my decision-making process, there\\\\'s no real change, no real change, no real change.', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] Any decision I need to make, in regards to him: Sometimes he's able to make a few decisions, explaining things to him, he doesn't always understand. We write it down or play it slowly and let him greet or listen. If he understands, he can make some decisions. He makes about 50% of decisions, and I make about 50%. Regarding him, there's no change in my decision-making process. I think twice before making any decisions, comparing alternatives, and considering many choices. However, regarding myself and my family, I don't share those decisions with him because he often forgets. For instance, it's your granddaughter's birthday, or it's your grandson's birthday, or it's your wife's birthday, or it's my birthday. We share those with him for the moment. But regarding real issues concerning my decision-making process, I don't share that with him, and there's no change.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] You know, when you say \\\"change in decision-making process,\\\" maybe because I\\\\'m frustrated, I make certain decisions. Or, because I\\\\'m angry, I make certain decisions. I\\\\'ve taught myself to control those, to calm myself down, to think it through, to listen to good music, or do something that helps me relax. When I\\\\'m settled, I can then make a good decision. Decisions made when you\\\\'re annoyed most times are not good, as at that point, you\\\\'re not fully in control of yourself. Such situations can be really terrible and have nasty consequences. I\\\\'ve taught myself how to control them. That\\\\'s definitely true. That\\\\'s definitely true.\\\\n\\\\nCaregiving affects decisions, too. Before I go on any vacation or do anything, I plan it well to ensure it doesn\\\\'t clash with critical hospital visits. I make sure any vacation or something doesn\\\\'t interfere with that.\\\\n\\\\nAs for location, I have a home here, so I don\\\\'t see any circumstances of me moving out of this area for at least the next 10 to 20 years. I\\\\'ve settled in, and I think I\\\\'m doing fine. But,\\\\n\\\\n--End of Response--', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] If there were perhaps a case or any circumstance that would require relocation or movement, I think there would definitely be a barrier. We would have to transfer hospitals and then establish a stable base at the new location. Feed them with all the necessary information and continue doing so there, as this is a significant factor I would consider before making such decisions, which could significantly impact him, such as my going on vacation or relocating somewhere. This is a major function I have to consider.\\\\n\\\\nNow, let's move on to the commitment page. Yes, definitely. Professional commitment, yes. Eversource has indeed affected some things for us.\\\\n\\\\nApril 20, yes. Keep practicing self. Manage daily stress. Describe yourself here, properties, and past weeks. Might the stress of caregiving share strategies?\\\\n\\\\nOK, well, self-care practices. I sometimes find caregiving very frustrating. You know, there are things I tell him that I forget. It can be quite annoying, as even a normal person would get annoyed with some things. I've taught myself to manage these stresses. It wasn't a one-day or two-year job; it's been over seven years now. So, I go for a walk when I'm feeling stressed.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] When I'm feeling stressed, you know, coming home from my full-time job creates a lot of difficulties and problems, and every other thing. And I just want peace. But I'm still dealing with a lot of things, you know, frustration sets in. Terrible mood swings, anger, and every other thing. So I learned to take a walk, you know, not when it's a critical situation where I need to be there. I will just take a walk or go to my music room, put on my earbuds, listen to music or play the piano, or do something that eases my stress. And I just go to the sitting room and watch Netflix. I just laugh, sometimes out loud, and then the stress is away. Some of the strategies I have employed to cope with daily stresses and every other thing are:\\\\n\\\\n1. Taking a walk\\\\n2. Going to the music room\\\\n3. Watching Netflix\\\\n4. Employing strategies to cope with stress\\\\n\\\\nI employ these strategies frequently, about five days a week.\\\\n\\\\nI try to make decisions not to get annoyed. You know, some things are supposed to make you annoyed, and then I just flush out the thought of being annoyed and take it as something normal. So, these are some of the major strategies I have employed as regards coping with daily stresses.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] The five days I received the job offer. Definitely very stressful. Well, I\\\\'d say that\\\\'s about him sticking to his routine. He knows what he should be doing at this time. He knows what he should be doing at that time. And then you ask him, \\\"Have you done this?\\\" \\\"Ohh, I\\\\'ve done it.\\\" But then you find out he hasn\\\\'t, okay. He has a call. He has a check-up call from the hospital while I\\\\'m at my job. And he\\\\'s not answering. He says, \\\"Oh, have you done this?\\\" and then says, \\\"Ohh, I don\\\\'t even know. I should have done that.\\\" You prepare. You want to eat this food and then make it, and then bring it, but he doesn\\\\'t want to eat it anymore. He wants to eat something else. A lot of those things come up. Those are just a few examples, and it\\\\'s very stressful and very annoying. That\\\\'s the fifth one, right? Yeah. Yeah, factors such as professional commitment and financial constraints, yes. Our professional commitment, definitely. There was a time I should have gone. You know, my company was planning to sponsor me on a trip to the United Kingdom for a seminar and some other fellowship, as well as some other knowledge and professional stuffs. It was meant to be a two-week trip. But I found a way to get someone to stay with him, and it all fell apart. I wasn\\\\'t able to go. It was really painful at that moment.', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] At that moment, I had to back out of the opportunity I had been waiting for all my life. It was frustrating and terrible. Well, yes, it is what it is. I have gotten something close, but it doesn't pin me down as much. And when I think of it, I'm supposed to do overtime sometimes just to get some extra cash, but I just can't. I have to dash out of the office on time because I have someone I'm caregiving for. I'm a caregiver, you know. It's really frustrating. And then you get home and meet other stresses and things. It's frustrating. So, professional commitments are a barrier for me, as far as I'm concerned, then financial constraints or health challenges. Well, financial constraints aren't really a problem for me at this moment. I'm above moderate and have a very good salary. My father, you know, he's worked things out for himself. So he has health insurance and other things covered by the job. So I don't really have to worry about financial stuff. It's all available. I wouldn't say financial constraints are a problem. Then there are health changes. Well, I sometimes fall sick and the sick person is still caring for a sick person. So I try my best not to fall sick.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] But when I do well, my wife actually takes the responsibility for doing what I\\\\'ve been doing. So I think that\\\\'s basically it. I get distracted. I get a lot of distraction, a lot, lots of distraction. You know, sometimes he just makes some emergency calls and then you pick up. \\\"What\\\\'s up?\\\" he says, and that would be really annoying. Like you call me five times and just want to hear my voice for what? And then I\\\\'m just, you know, I see your call. I\\\\'m panicking now. Maybe something is wrong and I just have to pick it up. You know, sometimes you see your call. Your brain says, \\\"I\\\\'m busy,\\\" or you just shoot them a text. \\\"I\\\\'m busy. I\\\\'ll call you later.\\\" And then that\\\\'s all.\\\\n\\\\nAnd when you\\\\'re done with your job, you call them. But you see the call. You know, it\\\\'s given for. So you just have to pick it up and then you say, \\\"Ohh, I just want to hear your voice.\\\" Why just want to do this and then you be like, \\\"Don\\\\'t call me.\\\" I have to pick up because of this and that. Don\\\\'t just call, because when I hear my voice, I\\\\'m busy at my job and with other things, and then he doesn\\\\'t hear and he keeps calling. So I get distracted a lot.\\\\n\\\\nBut it\\\\'s part of the job of caregiving, definitely. Well, yes, definitely. There are some positions we want to be promoted to, but it\\\\'s going to hit hard into the time of my caregiving. So I\\\\'ve declined a few of those offers.', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] And then I hope it gets much, much better soon, so I can have fewer hours of care given, and perhaps take some professional promotions. No, I sleep well. I sleep well. He sleeps very well and wakes up early, so I have few issues. At night, I sleep well. For me, or for him? No, no, no, no, none of those.\\\\n\\\\nOkay. And do you sometimes feel concerned about what the future holds for you in this role? Yes, definitely. I definitely think about that. I've brought up that issue in family meetings and other discussions. So, no one is willing to take responsibility. Everyone's busy. Everyone is doing this and that, and it just feels like I have to keep doing this forever. I've declined many professional opportunities. I should have gotten promoted, which is costing me more money and other things. Then, this cake remains a barrier and other obstacles. Thinking about other things, I definitely have thoughts about what the future holds for me in this role. If it continues like this for a long time, I would have declined numerous offers and might still be in the same position for years. I'm hoping very soon that I'll have enough finances.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] We can actually transfer him to a stable, professional home where we have professional caregivers and such. But our greatest hope is that his conditions improve, which would mean fewer hours of caregiving for us. And then, on the days we continue to be caregivers, we'll have fewer hours because he cannot do many things by himself. Doctors assure us that such a possibility is near in the future. We're also hoping that, if that doesn't work out, I won't be considering professional caregiving homes anymore. So that's it about that.\\\\n\\\\nThe truth is, if we could find someone to cover shifts when I'm active for two days a week and he's active for another two days, matching our schedules for another two days, or if I ask for 12 hours a day and he takes the other 12 hours, it would greatly ease my stress and burdens. And then, if we have enough finances, we could move him to a professional place \\u2013 the kind where they don't view it as a task but as their job, having been trained for it. They don't have anything else to stop them from doing their job. I believe those are the two best options.\\\\n\\\\nDefinitely, I think about that solution around 100% of the time.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] First of all, it\\\\'s financial basis, and then we\\\\'ve had a lot of stories about professional caregivers. You know, there have been instances of neglect and terrible happenings. That\\\\'s something he doesn\\\\'t want. He kicks against it. He doesn\\\\'t want it. We\\\\'ve brought up the idea in some meetings where the family is willing to donate and have that done. But he himself doesn\\\\'t want that. He says if we try that and he gets escaped from there, he\\\\'ll run off and do some of those things. You know, it\\\\'s really hard. He doesn\\\\'t want it. And we\\\\'re also concerned about the risk. That\\\\'s why we haven\\\\'t implemented it. He forgets a lot very frequently. Oh, no, he doesn\\\\'t forget me. He knows me, he knows me. But he mostly forgets other family members, not me, not me. And he doesn\\\\'t remember them. Yes, definitely.

Share how you have been feeling in the past few weeks while taking care of your loved one with dementia. Tell us about any moment, whether positive or challenging that stand out to you. It has been a negative life for me that's reduced my parting, my, my, my studies, everything about me. So it has been a difficult life life for me. Going to parties. I'm going to school too. I have stopped schools and I have been taking care of my mother. I have stopped school. There is no positive moment. In financial aspects, I don't have any money to take care of her again. Like whenever I'm cooking, she will be screaming, shouting, yelling. I will leave that to my meter again to take. Care of her. No, no positive moment. OK. Describe, OK, giving assisting you about well-being the past few weeks. Regarding your relationship with family, friends, or comics to the Internet, changes or shifts. Relationships. The question too I have not. I have not noticed any changes. It has been the way I have been given my life for the past five years. Yep. My family and friends have run away because I'm taking care of my mother. So I'm I'm the only one with her now. No, no, no, no. Sorry, I can't hear you. No, it doesn't affect me. Oh. My communication, my communication and my attention has been shot with my family and friends. My colleagues in the world in the school too. I invite only one of my friends has told by me for the past four years. Five years. So even if I should call her, call her, she will take like two to three days before she come to me. Yes, yes. I can't hear you please. Please repeat. I can't hear you. Yes. Sorry, question 3, right? My family, I I told you the other time. But my family and friends are no more. They have. They have gone. They left me alone. It's only one of my friends that stay with me. Whenever I call her. She used to take three to four days to come. OK. Over the past few weeks, have you and the kids are not engineers intention making process. You. Yes please. My decision making has changed. Due to the food I eat at home. Financial everything. Because of the of my mother's sickness. Yes, yes, I do think about her. I have to put her into consideration first. Number four question, describe your self-care practices in the past few weeks to manage the daily stresses of caregiving, share your strategy strategies that have been particularly helpful in coping with the steady stress of caregiving. OK, #1. The time I cook for her. Time I do, I do take care of her. Time of caring, time of management. Time of making her happy. That's OK, then that's what I can say for that number four question please. I go on social media. Will I surf the Internet? To rest, I used to rest. Whenever I take care of us and I. Whenever she is asleep, I used to sleep too. I used to take a rest. My make sure I wake up before. I used to sleep very well before and go out, go to schools, go to clubs. I used to party very well, but now I don't used to do that again. I used to drive I I will put on a car and drive out wherever, whenever, wherever I'm going. Sorry, I can't hear you. No, nobody either. It's to go out. I don't used to leave her at home and go out. I go with. I go out with her, I'll put her inside the car and go out. Nobody to stay with her. In the past few weeks of earning factors such as professional commitment, financial constraints for health challenges influence how you fees, and based on this. These special therapists are attention caregiver used to allow her to allow the person to come, but now there is no financial support again from anybody. So I had to go and. I had to carry out to the government hospital for caring. Yes, there is no changes cause I don't have any money. I'm not. I'm not financially buoyant now. Sorry, I can't hear. Yes, I can't hear you. Fair enough. I'm I'm fair enough. Fair enough. Health my isn't my home or my mother's health. My health. At least I'm copying a little. I get tired. Stress is too much for me. I get tired every now and then. I'm because I'm taking care of my mother because I'm I'm a caregiver to my mother. I've not seen any support from anyone. I work remotely. And just work for three hours and remaining hours is for taking care of her. No, he's answer my mother. I'm doing it because of my mother. I'll just make sure that I have given her her drugs, her food, and then I'll start working. It has reduced my wages. Like. Like 2 weeks ago now when I was working she she was awake. I had to stop the work when I was what? What? I had to stop what I was doing then attended. Attend to her. And this has. Affected me in a lot of ways. What do I do? Ah, I used to give her more than. More than 10 hours. As a key given, do you sometimes feel concerned about what the future holds for you in that room? If so, could you share more about it? What kind of help or support will bear for you? The Economist question as a caregiver, do you sometimes feel concerned about the future? What the future holds for you in that? If so, yes, yes, yes, because I need a partner. I will still have, I'll, I'm going to give birth, have my husband and get married one day. So I need an assistant. I need a partner too. Yes. No, no, no, no. No. Please repeat the question. I can't hear you. Yes. Yes, I'm here. I'm here. I need to dedicate my time to her. The voting of attention to. And financial support. I can't remember, not really. I can't remember anything now. Like the moment I I went to go and look for some jobs to do. And she needs my attention. So I had to attend to her before going. She can Remember Me. I show her some old videos of ours, some pictures and lots more. She she react amazingly. She goes into her room when someone. Comes in. As in she as she reacts amazingly, sometimes not every time. No, no, no, she doesn't. No, she remembers me. No, no, no. I don't used to allow her to go outside alone. Two times in a week. No, no, not him. Stressful.\",\n          \"OK, my name is. Yeah. My name is John Smith. I am 26 years old and I am a child to the, you know, the person with dementia. Is my father, OK? And I'm the only one who is the major caregiver. OK, answering question one well. For the past few weeks. Yeah, it's about 7 years, 7 to 8 years. He's 57. Why so? Weak. Yeah, I'm. I'm always with him. He stays with me. We stay together. So before going to my job, I ensure he's fine. I provide every basic things he needs. You know he slowed his, his emails, his phone calls, voicemails he has, and sure everything are kept in check. And sure, he's using his medication. They are all set before I go to my job at my job. I always calling I calling at least twice. To check on him to make sure he's doing fine, make sure he's not having any reaction or side effects to the medication. Make sure he's resting. One is supposed to make sure he's doing the little exercise that has been prepared for him. You know when I'm back. Also, I take him, we go for a walk, take a stroll around. We do little exercise. Sometimes we go to church together. There. And sure, he also eats well, eat fruits, eats the necessary things. Those use medication, those little exercise, then also on the days of his visit to the hospital. And sure, I take him there on time. I'm always saying while he's in the. Doctor. We are done, you know, come back home. So it's just like a normal thing you do for your child. So it I immediately I'm responsible for most of the things. OK, someone says that. OK, well, for the past few weeks I would say the pressure is much more lesser than before. Then I had you know, when we first started, it was a lot for me to taking balancing being a caregiver and also having a full time job. It's really, really tough. It's really tough. And then being at an entry level, someone with little or no, you know superiority, I have buses, which I'm also under their command. You know, it's really hard to have my wish in time like that. So then also it's it's always very difficult coping with the new development. You know things your father can do before easily before you find it. You say that he's having a hard time doing them and you always just have to be around and ensuring that it does it right. So it's always very tough to take in. It's really hard to believe that this is happening. So for for the past few weeks. Ice after that I'm finding it a little bit more easier because I've let it become part of me. I've let it become something I do, you know, not because I want to receive an award for some, you know, some people work because they just want to get a pay. Some people do some things because they just want to, you know, receive profits from it. But when you do something because of the. All of you have for the person. You don't count it as something that, even if it's not reciprocated. Well, you don't see it as anything, so I've learned to teach myself to do it because I love my father and my parents and I would. I'm willing to go extra mile to make sure they're OK. They're fine because they've also sacrificed a lot for me. And so for the past few weeks, I have made it my habits, you know, something I do without being for something I do without seeing it. That's a hard job, though. There's a lot of challenge, definitely a lot of challenge. Tell him something. He forgets it easily has few reactions. Some things you did yesterday. You can remember some things. You know, a lot of things, a lot of challenges, but I've learned to just calm down. You know, sometimes when it's overwhelming, I just take a. Walk. Or just listen to music or just do something to calm me myself down because I cannot be transferring aggression to him. I cannot show any sign of no anger and any other things because. It would really, really affect his own well-being, so I rather would rather take a walk on his throat, or rather just turn my earbuds on and listen to loud music. Or. Just do something to just chill off before I can actually think on what next to. Do. So I would say I'm really coping nicely and I'm finding strategies to make it much more easier for me. So that's how that is. OK. Well, relationship with friends, family and colleagues definitely there is a shift. I spend more time at home. Apart from my job, apart from my job, you know most times then I would love to socialize, you know, visit friends, go to watch a game, go to at the club, go to lottery houses, you know. I spent my most of my free times there. My weekends, you know, I'm socializing. I'm hanging out. I'm doing a lot of stuff. Sports. Now I have to spend there with my parents, my. Dad. Because he needs the care and everything is getting better though, but he needs the care so. That's affected my relationship with my friends. And well, it makes me and my wife have much more time together since I'm spending more time at home with my father and she's always around too. So but with my friends, that's really severed relationship. We do a lot of call video calls, you know, voice calls to kind of compensate for. May not being able to show up there. Sometimes that some occasions will clash with the days he has to go to the hospital and I just have to. Cancel. The occasion, you know, so it's really done a little to that, my friends, my colleagues, you know, my colleague, maybe. Having a birthday celebration at his home or he's having an occasion and it's classes with sometime. By the time I have to just be. With my dad. So. Most of them do actually understand. They understand my situation and they don't get annoyed, but definitely I would say it has really affected it has made me more introvert. No staying indoors. And. Just loving things I can do indoors, you know, and I only go out when I have to. Apart from my job. Sometimes I take. My dad also sees to see a game because he loves basketball. So we go to watch some basketball. Sometimes makes him more happy, makes him lively. You know, you see him celebrate him when he sees. Says he hook. He goes cold and some other things makes him more lively, you know, it adds makes health better and some other things. So that's pretty much how when I go out and then the relationship with my friends and colleagues, it has done a little damage to it, definitely. Definitely it is. It is I it has. It is about where it's stopping me from going out and it's making me spend more time at home, spend more time with my dad, just ensuring that. Things are going as it should so, but I don't see that. As you know, when you people say barrier, you know it's something very negative, something terrible, something you don't want to, but it is what it is. And now I'm not seeing it as a barrier. I'm just saying that is that how can I describe it as an alternative? You know, I'm learning a new way of life instead of being that you know. Extroverts talk so much going out, partying, having so much fun, spending money, wasting money and wasting time doing some other. Things. I now taking all those energies and transfer it into something useful apart from while I'm even caregiving, I have some remote things I do I trade crypto, I do some other things, so I want to say it's a barrier anymore. It has taught me how to actually invest in myself and do things while I'm at home, so that also helped me in a way. OK. Well, in my decision making process, I think. No real change, no real change, no real change. Any decision I need to make, you know, in regards. To. Him. Sometimes he actually is able to make few decisions, sometimes you know, explaining some things to him he doesn't understand. We write it down and let him greet, or we play it and let him listen to it very slowly. And then if he understands, he can make some decisions. He makes about 50% of decisions and I make about 50. So in regards to him, I don't think there is any change in my decision making process and then it's more than fine. I think twice before I make any decisions, I compare my alternatives. I consider a lot of choices before I can actually make a decision, but as regards myself well, some decisions I make as regards my own life. I shared this with my wife. There's no real need of sharing with my dad, because even if I shared with him before tomorrow, he forgets or something like that. So my decisions as regards myself, my family, I don't really share them with him because he don't really are remembers most of those things and the few ones that actually you know like maybe. Ah ohh. It's your granddaughter birthday. Or it's your grandson's birthday or something like that. Ohh it's your. It's your wife's birthday or it's my birthday. You know, things like that. That they're just for the moment. So we share those with him. But you know, real issues as regarding my decision making process. I don't share that. With him and. There is no change. You know when you say change in decision making process, maybe because I'm frustrated. I make certain decisions or because I'm angry, I make certain decisions I've taught myself so much to be able to control all those, calm myself down, take it through, listen to good music, do something that just, you know, it's a little stressful now. Then when I'm come, when I'm settled, I can now think my. Way out of making a very good decision because when you make decisions when you are annoyed most times it is end of the time. There are no good decisions because at that point I won't say you've lost your mind, but you are totally out. Of yourself and. Such situation might be really, really terrible and have nasty consequences, so I've taught myself how. To control them. Yeah, that that is definitely true. That's definitely true. Caregiving. Yes, definitely, it does affect it affects those decisions. You know, I, before I go for any vacation of stuff, I have to plan it very well and it sure it doesn't clash with you stuffs, especially critical visits to the hospitals. The. So I make sure any vacation or something doesn't tamper with that. Well about location, I have a home here, so I don't see any circumstance of me, you know, moving out of this area for at least for the next 1020 years. So I love this place. I settled in and I think I'm doing fine. So but. If there would be maybe a case or maybe any circumstance that would actually need the relocation or movement, I think there even would definitely be a barrier because we have to actually transfer hospitals and then get a stable around the place where we are. And feed them with all the previous information they need to know and then continue doing it there, because it definitely is a factor I would consider before I make such kinds of huge decisions, you know, decisions that would really affect him, like me going on vacation or locating or going for holidays somewhere or something. It is a. Major function that I have to consider. OK, now commitment page. Yeah, definitely. Professional commitment, yes. And Eversource definitely, they have affected some things with us. 04/20 OK yeah, self keep practicing. Yeah, manage daily stress. Describe yourself here, properties and past weeks. Might the stress of caregiving share strategies? OK, well, self-care practices. Like I said, sometimes it gets very frustrating. You know, sometimes some things you tell him you forget. It's really annoying because sometimes it's annoying. Definitely any normal person will get annoyed with some things. Like I said in previous recordings I have taught myself to manage these stresses. It wasn't a day's job or two years job or three years. Job. It's been over 7 years now. So. I go for a walk when I'm having. When I'm feeling stress, you know, having gone to my full time job makes a lot of difficulties and stuffs problems and every other thing. And I'm coming back and then I just want peace. Then I'm still having a lot of things to deal with, you know, frustration sets in. Terrible mood swings, anger and every other thing. So I learned to take a walk, you know, once it's not that it's in a critical situation where I need to be there. I will just take a walk or I just go to my music room, put on my earbuds, listen to music or play the piano, or do something that would ease my stress. And I just even go to sitting room and just watch Netflix. And just laugh, laugh out sometimes and then. Is the stress away, so some of the strategies have actually been employing and sure I go away from that. You know, I I go away from where he is and just try to ease the with the stress and then. And then sometimes. And then sometimes. I just you know. I just try to cope with it. I makes the decisions not to get annoyed. You know, some things are supposed to make you annoyed and then. To see. Why am I? Why am I? Why am I even getting annoyed for no reason? Listen, isn't something much that should get me annoyed? And then I just flush out the thought of being annoyed and then take it as something normal. So. I think those are some of the major strategies I have employed as regards coping with daily stresses and every other stuff. How frequently? I'll say 5, I'll say majorly five days a week. The five days I got my job. Definitely very stressful. Well. I would say is about him keeping to his routine. He knows what he should be doing at this time. He knows what he should be doing at that time. And then you ask him, have you done this? Ohh, I've done it. Then you find out he's not done it, OK. He has a call. He has a check up call from the hospital while I'm at my job. And he's not. He's not picking them up. He's not answering. And he say, oh, have you done this and say ohh, I don't even know. That I should. Have done that and then you prepare. You want to eat this food and then you make it and then you bring it and he doesn't want to eat it anymore. He wants to eat something else. You know, a lot of those things come up. Those are just a few of the examples and it's very stressful and very annoying. That's the fifth one, right? Yeah. Yeah, factors such as professional commitment, financial constraints, yes. Our professional commitment definitely you know there was a time I should. You know have. I my company was planning to actually sponsor me on a trip to, I think to the United Kingdom you. Know. For a seminar and some other fellowship, and then for some other knowledge and professional stuffs, it was meant to be two weeks. And then I found a way to get someone to stay with him and every other thing, and it just fell apart and I wasn't able to go. It was really painful at that moment. At that moment, I, you know, just had to back out of the opportunity that I had been waiting all my life. For. And then. It was frustrating and terrible. Well, yeah, it is what it is. I have gotten something close. That now so it doesn't pin me so much. And when I think of it so a lot of professional commitments, you know, sometimes I am supposed to do over some over time just to get some extra cash and then I just can't, I just have to be dashing out of the office money time because I have someone. I'm caregiving you. Know. It's really, really frustrating. And then you get home. And you meet some other stress and some other. Things. Frustrating. So I would say professional commitment. Care given standards, A barrier between a lot of professional commitments as far as I'm concerned, then financial constraints or health challenges, well, financial constraints for me at this moment. Well, I thank God, I think I'm I'm I'm above moderate and in a very good salary. My father also you know he's worked some things down for himself. So he has his health insurance and some other things that basically covered by the job and things he has done while he was still active. So I don't really have support and care about financial stuff. It is well available. So I won't say financial constraints is really any problem. Then health changes. Well, sometimes I also fall sick and then the sick person still caring for a sick person. So I try my as best as much as I as I can not to. Fall sick. But when I do I well, my wife actually takes the. Takes the responsibility of. Doing what I've been doing, so I think that's basically it. I get distracted. Get a lot of distraction, a lot, lots of distraction. You know, sometimes he just makes some emergency call and then you pick up and you be like, what's up? And says, I just want to hear your voice. You know, and that would be really annoying. Like you call me five times and just want to hear my voice for what? And then I'm just, you know, I see your call. I'm panicking now. Maybe something is wrong and I just have to pick it up. You know, sometimes you see your. Call. You know my brain and say, oh, I'm busy or you just shoot them a text. I'm busy. I'll call you later. And then that's all. And when you are done with job, you call them. But you see the call, you know. It you know, is someone OK given for. So you just have to pick it up and then you say ohh I just want to hear your voice. Why just want to do this and then you be like don't call. Me like this when I see your call. I have to pick up because. Of this and that don't just call, because when I hear my voice, I'm busy at my job and some other things, and then he doesn't hear and he keeps calling. So I get distracted a lot. So, but it's part of the job of caregiving, definitely. Well, yes, definitely. There are some positions I want us to be promoted to, but it's going to definitely hit hit into the time of my care given. So I've declined few of those offers. And then I hope it gets very, very much more better soon then I can have less hours care given and then maybe take some professional, you know promotions. No, I sleep well. I sleep well. Eat good. He sleeps very. He sleeps very early and he wakes up late, so I hardly have any issues. At night I sleep well. For me or for him? No, no, no, no, none of those. OK. And do you sometimes feel concerned about what the future holds for you in the room? Yeah, definitely. I definitely think about that. I definitely think about that. I've table that, you know, in the family meetings and some other stuff. So, you know, no one is willing to take responsibility. Everyone's busy. Everyone is doing this and that and it just feels. Like I just have to keep doing this forever and then I think that, well, I've actually declined a lot of professional things. I should have, you know, gotten promoted and getting costing me more money, getting me, you know, some other things and. Then. This cake even is staying as a barrier and some other things and. You know, just thinking about some other things. So I definitely have the thoughts most of the time what the future holds for me in this role because if it continues like this for a long time, you know I would have. To decline a. Lot. Of offers along the line, and I might still be in the same. Position for years, so I consider that and then I'm hoping very soon that one actually have enough finances. We can actually transfer him to a stable, you know, professional home where we have professional caregivers and stuff like that. But the utmost prayer is that his conditions improve, and then we actually have less hours of caregiving. And then. We are still caregivers that day, but we have less hours because he cannot do many things by himself. Well, doctors are promised that that is a possibility in the nearest future. We are also hoping that God, if that is possible, but if that doesn't work out, then at some point I. Won't. Be considering I would be considering. Professional caregiving homes. So I guess that's it about that. Well, the truth is, if I have someone, someone else, if we can run something like a shift when I'm active for these two days a week and then he's active for another two days and match for another two days, or I'm asking for 12 hours a day and then he takes the other 12 hours. You know, something like that, it would ease me of a lot of stress, a lot of burdens. And then. If possibly if we have enough finances and we can just move him to a professional place, you know those ones, they don't see it as a task. They've been trained for that and then they do it to any living. So that's their job. They don't have something else. To stop. In them so. I think those might be the two great options. OK. Yeah, definitely, definitely. I think about that by the percent of the time. First of all, it's financial basis and then also we've had a lot of stories about professional caregivers, you know, neglect and terrible happenings that we've had. That doesn't want he he he kicks, he kicks against it. He doesn't want it. We've actually brought up in some meetings where the family is willing to donate and then get that done. But he himself doesn't want that. He says if we try that and he gets escaped from there, he's gonna run off and do some of that stuffs. You know, it's really hard. He doesn't want it. And then we also we are concerned about the risk. So that's why we're not really implemented. He forgets a lot very frequently. Ohh me. No, he doesn't forget me. He doesn't forget me. He knows me, he knows me. Mostly forget some other family members, but not not me, not me. And doesn't remember them. Yeah, definitely. Like, oh, what are you? What are you looking for? You know sometimes like, oh, oh, John, I have a stranger in this house. It's trying to come to the front door doing this and that, you know, I've had calls like that when my wife, you know, my wife was back at her job and then he called me up. Ohh John, I have this a woman, a lady at my door. I don't know what she's looking for. Can you call the cops? Can you do this? And I'm like it's my wife for God's. Sake. So you have issues like that so, but he's not aggressive towards them. He just wants to know who is who and what is what. And I'm sure he's safe. I would say progressive. Out to neutral. Yeah. So I don't read it, read it. Well, I feel I might share my experiences and then I was thinking maybe there are some resources that can actually help me caregiving journey, maybe something like that would also be shared during the meeting. So those are the things.

Bonnie. I'm 28 years old. Single. I live with my parents. I stay with my parents, as I do who I am. I give care to them, very well. I am the only caregiver for my mother, who is 56 years old. It's been five years since I've been caring for her.\\\\n\\\\nShare how you have been feeling in the past few weeks while taking care of your loved one with dementia. Tell us about any moment, whether positive or challenging, that stands out to you. It's been a difficult life for me, reducing my participation in studies and other aspects of my life. So the past few weeks have been a challenging time for me.\\\\n\\\\nGoing to parties and school are things I've had to stop. I've stopped going to school to take care of my mother. No positive moments stand out.\\\\n\\\\nIn financial aspects, I don't have any money to continue taking care of her. Cooking for her can be difficult, as she often screams, shouts, and yells. I leave her care to my meter when I can.\\\\n\\\\nRegarding your relationships with family, friends, or anyone online, have there been any changes or shifts? I haven't noticed any changes. My life has been this way for the past five years.\\\\n\\\\nMy family and friends have distanced themselves because I'm taking care of my mother. I'm the only one with her now. No, it doesn't affect me.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] My communication and attention have been divided among my family and friends, as well as my colleagues at school. I've only managed to invite one friend to join me for the past four to five years. Even when I call her, it takes her two to three days to respond. I'm having trouble hearing you. Could you please repeat? I can't hear you. Yes, I believe that's question 3.\\\\n\\\\nMy family and I discussed the other time that my family and friends are no longer with me. They have left me alone. Only one friend remains with whom I can call. She used to take three to four days to come when I called.\\\\n\\\\nOver the past few weeks, you and the kids have not been involved in the engineering process intentionally. I've made some changes in my decision-making process. This is due to the food I eat at home and the financial situation, as well as my mother's sickness. I often think about her and prioritize her needs first.\\\\n\\\\nRegarding question 4, I'd be happy to describe my self-care practices over the past few weeks to manage the daily stresses of caregiving. My strategies for coping with the steady stress of caregiving include:\\\\n\\\\n1. The time I spend cooking for her and taking care of her. This time is dedicated to her care, management, and making her happy.\\\\n2. I engage in social media and surf the internet as a means of rest.\\\\n\\\\n(Note: The original text did not contain a clear question or prompt for response, so I assumed the response should address the general topic of self-care practices and coping strategies for caregiving.)\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] Whenever I take care of us, and I, whenever she is asleep, I used to sleep too. I used to take a rest. My responsibility is to make sure I wake up before she does. I used to sleep very well before and go out, go to schools, go to clubs. I used to party very well, but now I don't do that anymore. I used to drive and just put the car on and go wherever, whenever, wherever I was going. (Pause) I can't hear you. No, nobody is there. It's to go out. I didn't used to leave her at home and go out. I go out with her now. I'll put her inside the car and go out. Nobody is there to stay with her.\\\\n\\\\nIn the past few weeks, earning factors such as professional commitment, financial constraints, and health challenges have influenced how I manage my fees. Based on this, these special therapists used to allow her to come, but now there is no financial support from anyone. So, I had to go and carry out my caregiving duties at the government hospital. (Pause) Yes, there have been no changes because I don't have any money. I'm not financially buoyant now. (Pause) I can't hear you.\\\\n\\\\nYes, my health isn't my home or my mother's health. My health is a concern for me. At least I'm coping a little. I get tired. Stress is too much for me. I get tired every now and then. I'm a caregiver to my mother because I take care of her. I've not seen any support from anyone. I work remotely.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] And I work for her for three hours, and the remaining hours are for taking care of her. No, she's not the one answering me. I'm doing it because of my mother. I'll just make sure that I have given her her drugs, her food, and then I'll start working. It has reduced my wages.\\\\n\\\\nLike, two weeks ago, when I was working, she was awake. I had to stop what I was doing then and attend to her. This has affected me in a lot of ways. What do I do? Ah, I used to give her more than ten hours of care. As a caregiver, do you sometimes feel concerned about what the future holds for you in that role? If so, could you share more about it? What kind of help or support will you need?\\\\n\\\\nThe Economist asks, as a caregiver, do you sometimes feel concerned about the future? What does the future hold for you in that role?

I can't hear you. Yes. Yes, I'm here. I'm here. I need to dedicate my time to her. I require both her attention and financial support. I can't remember, not really. I can't remember anything now. Like the moment I went to look for some jobs to do, and she needed my attention. So I had to attend to her before going. She can remember me. I show her some old videos of ours, some pictures, and lots more.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] She reacts amazingly. She goes into her room when someone comes in. As she reacts amazingly, sometimes, not every time. No, she doesn't react that way. No, she remembers me. No, she didn't used to allow him to go outside alone, but she did it two times a week. No, it's not him. Stressful.\\\"]\",\n          \"[\\\"\\\\n  [/INST] My name is John Smith. I'm 26 years old. I'm the only child of a person with dementia. Is my father? I'm the major caregiver. I've been doing well with answering question one for the past few weeks, for about 7 to 8 years. He's 57. Why is he this way? It's weak. I'm always with him. He stays with me. We stay together. Before going to my job, I ensure he's fine. I provide every basic thing he needs. He's slowed down with his emails, phone calls, voicemails, and I make sure they're all kept in check. I ensure he's using his medication, which are all set before I go to my job. I call at least twice a day to check on him, to make sure he's doing fine, to ensure he's not having any reactions or side effects to the medication, and to make sure he's resting. One should make sure he's doing the little exercise that's been prepared for him. When I'm back, we go for walks, take a stroll around. We do little exercises together. Sometimes we go to church together. He also eats well, eats fruits, and consumes the necessary things. Those on medication, those little exercises, and the hospital visits are also taken care of. I take him to the hospital on time. It's just like taking care of a normal child. I'm immediately responsible for most of the things.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] \\\"OK, someone says that. Well, for the past few weeks, I would say the pressure is much less than before. I had to acknowledge, when we first started, it was a lot for me to balance being a caregiver and having a full-time job. It\\\\'s really tough. It\\\\'s really tough. And then, being at an entry level, with little or no superiority, I have buses to contend with, which I\\\\'m also under their command. It\\\\'s really hard for me to have my wishes met in a timely manner. So, it\\\\'s always very difficult to cope with new developments. You know, things your father could do before easily, you find him having a hard time doing them, and you always have to be around and ensure that they\\\\'re done right. It\\\\'s always very tough to take in. It\\\\'s really hard to believe that this is happening. So, for the past few weeks, I\\\\'ve found it a little bit easier because I\\\\'ve let it become a part of me. I\\\\'ve let it become something I do, not because I want to receive an award or profits from it, but because I love my father and parents, and I would.\\\"', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] I'm willing to go the extra mile to make sure they're okay. They're fine because they've also sacrificed a lot for me. And so, for the past few weeks, I have made it a habit to do something without seeing it as a chore. That's a hard job, though. There's a lot of challenge, definitely. He forgets things easily and has few reactions. Some things you did yesterday, you can remember some of them. You know, a lot of things, a lot of challenges, but I've learned to just calm down. You know, sometimes when it's overwhelming, I just take a walk. Or just listen to music or just do something to calm myself down because I cannot transfer aggression to him. I cannot show any sign of anger and other things because it would really, really affect his own well-being. So, I rather take a walk or turn on my earbuds and listen to loud music. Or just do something to chill off before I can actually think about what next to do.\\\\n\\\\nSo, I would say I'm really coping nicely and finding strategies to make it much easier for me. So that's how it is.\\\\n\\\\nOK. Well, the relationship with friends, family, and colleagues has definitely shifted. I spend more time at home, apart from my job. Most times, I would love to socialize, you know, visit friends, go to watch a game, go to the club, go to lottery houses, you know.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] I spent most of my free time there. My weekends, you know, I'm socializing. I'm hanging out. I'm doing a lot of stuff. Sports. Now I have to spend time there with my parents, my dad. Because he needs care and everything is getting better, though he needs care. That's affected my relationship with my friends. And well, it makes me and my wife have much more time together since I'm spending more time at home with my father, and she's always around too. So, but with my friends, that's really severed the relationship. We do a lot of call video calls, you know, voice calls to kind of compensate for not being able to show up there. Sometimes, some occasions will clash with the days he has to go to the hospital, and I just have to cancel. The occasion, you know, so it's really done a little to that, my friends, my colleagues, you know, my colleague, maybe. Having a birthday celebration at his home or he's having an occasion, and it clashes with some classes. By the time I have to just be with my dad. So. Most of them do actually understand. They understand my situation, and they don't get annoyed, but definitely, I would say it has really affected me. It has made me more introverted. No staying outdoors. And, just loving things I can do indoors, you know, and I only go out when I have to, apart from my job. Sometimes, I take my dad to see a game because he loves basketball. So, we go to watch some basketball. Sometimes, it makes him happier, makes him livelier.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] You know, you see him celebrating when he sees. Says he, \\\"I hook him.\\\" He goes cold and some other things make him more lively. You know, it adds to making his health better and some other things. So that\\\\'s pretty much how it goes when I go out, and then the relationship with my friends and colleagues has done a little damage to it, definitely. Definitely, it is. It is I who it has stopped. It\\\\'s about where it\\\\'s stopping me from going out and making me spend more time at home, more time with my dad, just ensuring that things are going as they should. But I don\\\\'t see that.\\\\n\\\\nAs you know, when people say barrier, you know it\\\\'s something very negative, something terrible, something you don\\\\'t want. But it is what it is. And now I\\\\'m not seeing it as a barrier. I\\\\'m just saying that\\\\'s how I can describe it as an alternative. You know, I\\\\'m learning a new way of life instead of being the extrovert who talks so much about going out, partying, having so much fun, spending money, wasting money, and wasting time doing other things. Now, I\\\\'m taking all those energies and transferring them into something useful, apart from caregiving. I have some remote things I do, like trading crypto, and I do other things. So I want to say it\\\\'s no longer a barrier. It has taught me how to actually invest in myself and do things while I\\\\'m at home, which also helped me in a way.\\\\n\\\\nOK. Well, in my decision-making process, there\\\\'s no real change, no real change, no real change.', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] Any decision I need to make, in regards to him: Sometimes he's able to make a few decisions, explaining things to him, he doesn't always understand. We write it down or play it slowly and let him greet or listen. If he understands, he can make some decisions. He makes about 50% of decisions, and I make about 50%. Regarding him, there's no change in my decision-making process. I think twice before making any decisions, comparing alternatives, and considering many choices. However, regarding myself and my family, I don't share those decisions with him because he often forgets. For instance, it's your granddaughter's birthday, or it's your grandson's birthday, or it's your wife's birthday, or it's my birthday. We share those with him for the moment. But regarding real issues concerning my decision-making process, I don't share that with him, and there's no change.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] You know, when you say \\\"change in decision-making process,\\\" maybe because I\\\\'m frustrated, I make certain decisions. Or, because I\\\\'m angry, I make certain decisions. I\\\\'ve taught myself to control those, to calm myself down, to think it through, to listen to good music, or do something that helps me relax. When I\\\\'m settled, I can then make a good decision. Decisions made when you\\\\'re annoyed most times are not good, as at that point, you\\\\'re not fully in control of yourself. Such situations can be really terrible and have nasty consequences. I\\\\'ve taught myself how to control them. That\\\\'s definitely true. That\\\\'s definitely true.\\\\n\\\\nCaregiving affects decisions, too. Before I go on any vacation or do anything, I plan it well to ensure it doesn\\\\'t clash with critical hospital visits. I make sure any vacation or something doesn\\\\'t interfere with that.\\\\n\\\\nAs for location, I have a home here, so I don\\\\'t see any circumstances of me moving out of this area for at least the next 10 to 20 years. I\\\\'ve settled in, and I think I\\\\'m doing fine. But,\\\\n\\\\n--End of Response--', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] If there were perhaps a case or any circumstance that would require relocation or movement, I think there would definitely be a barrier. We would have to transfer hospitals and then establish a stable base at the new location. Feed them with all the necessary information and continue doing so there, as this is a significant factor I would consider before making such decisions, which could significantly impact him, such as my going on vacation or relocating somewhere. This is a major function I have to consider.\\\\n\\\\nNow, let's move on to the commitment page. Yes, definitely. Professional commitment, yes. Eversource has indeed affected some things for us.\\\\n\\\\nApril 20, yes. Keep practicing self. Manage daily stress. Describe yourself here, properties, and past weeks. Might the stress of caregiving share strategies?\\\\n\\\\nOK, well, self-care practices. I sometimes find caregiving very frustrating. You know, there are things I tell him that I forget. It can be quite annoying, as even a normal person would get annoyed with some things. I've taught myself to manage these stresses. It wasn't a one-day or two-year job; it's been over seven years now. So, I go for a walk when I'm feeling stressed.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] When I'm feeling stressed, you know, coming home from my full-time job creates a lot of difficulties and problems, and every other thing. And I just want peace. But I'm still dealing with a lot of things, you know, frustration sets in. Terrible mood swings, anger, and every other thing. So I learned to take a walk, you know, not when it's a critical situation where I need to be there. I will just take a walk or go to my music room, put on my earbuds, listen to music or play the piano, or do something that eases my stress. And I just go to the sitting room and watch Netflix. I just laugh, sometimes out loud, and then the stress is away. Some of the strategies I have employed to cope with daily stresses and every other thing are:\\\\n\\\\n1. Taking a walk\\\\n2. Going to the music room\\\\n3. Watching Netflix\\\\n4. Employing strategies to cope with stress\\\\n\\\\nI employ these strategies frequently, about five days a week.\\\\n\\\\nI try to make decisions not to get annoyed. You know, some things are supposed to make you annoyed, and then I just flush out the thought of being annoyed and take it as something normal. So, these are some of the major strategies I have employed as regards coping with daily stresses.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] The five days I received the job offer. Definitely very stressful. Well, I\\\\'d say that\\\\'s about him sticking to his routine. He knows what he should be doing at this time. He knows what he should be doing at that time. And then you ask him, \\\"Have you done this?\\\" \\\"Ohh, I\\\\'ve done it.\\\" But then you find out he hasn\\\\'t, okay. He has a call. He has a check-up call from the hospital while I\\\\'m at my job. And he\\\\'s not answering. He says, \\\"Oh, have you done this?\\\" and then says, \\\"Ohh, I don\\\\'t even know. I should have done that.\\\" You prepare. You want to eat this food and then make it, and then bring it, but he doesn\\\\'t want to eat it anymore. He wants to eat something else. A lot of those things come up. Those are just a few examples, and it\\\\'s very stressful and very annoying. That\\\\'s the fifth one, right? Yeah. Yeah, factors such as professional commitment and financial constraints, yes. Our professional commitment, definitely. There was a time I should have gone. You know, my company was planning to sponsor me on a trip to the United Kingdom for a seminar and some other fellowship, as well as some other knowledge and professional stuffs. It was meant to be a two-week trip. But I found a way to get someone to stay with him, and it all fell apart. I wasn\\\\'t able to go. It was really painful at that moment.', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] At that moment, I had to back out of the opportunity I had been waiting for all my life. It was frustrating and terrible. Well, yes, it is what it is. I have gotten something close, but it doesn't pin me down as much. And when I think of it, I'm supposed to do overtime sometimes just to get some extra cash, but I just can't. I have to dash out of the office on time because I have someone I'm caregiving for. I'm a caregiver, you know. It's really frustrating. And then you get home and meet other stresses and things. It's frustrating. So, professional commitments are a barrier for me, as far as I'm concerned, then financial constraints or health challenges. Well, financial constraints aren't really a problem for me at this moment. I'm above moderate and have a very good salary. My father, you know, he's worked things out for himself. So he has health insurance and other things covered by the job. So I don't really have to worry about financial stuff. It's all available. I wouldn't say financial constraints are a problem. Then there are health changes. Well, I sometimes fall sick and the sick person is still caring for a sick person. So I try my best not to fall sick.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] But when I do well, my wife actually takes the responsibility for doing what I\\\\'ve been doing. So I think that\\\\'s basically it. I get distracted. I get a lot of distraction, a lot, lots of distraction. You know, sometimes he just makes some emergency calls and then you pick up. \\\"What\\\\'s up?\\\" he says, and that would be really annoying. Like you call me five times and just want to hear my voice for what? And then I\\\\'m just, you know, I see your call. I\\\\'m panicking now. Maybe something is wrong and I just have to pick it up. You know, sometimes you see your call. Your brain says, \\\"I\\\\'m busy,\\\" or you just shoot them a text. \\\"I\\\\'m busy. I\\\\'ll call you later.\\\" And then that\\\\'s all.\\\\n\\\\nAnd when you\\\\'re done with your job, you call them. But you see the call. You know, it\\\\'s given for. So you just have to pick it up and then you say, \\\"Ohh, I just want to hear your voice.\\\" Why just want to do this and then you be like, \\\"Don\\\\'t call me.\\\" I have to pick up because of this and that. Don\\\\'t just call, because when I hear my voice, I\\\\'m busy at my job and with other things, and then he doesn\\\\'t hear and he keeps calling. So I get distracted a lot.\\\\n\\\\nBut it\\\\'s part of the job of caregiving, definitely. Well, yes, definitely. There are some positions we want to be promoted to, but it\\\\'s going to hit hard into the time of my caregiving. So I\\\\'ve declined a few of those offers.', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] And then I hope it gets much, much better soon, so I can have fewer hours of care given, and perhaps take some professional promotions. No, I sleep well. I sleep well. He sleeps very well and wakes up early, so I have few issues. At night, I sleep well. For me, or for him? No, no, no, no, none of those.\\\\n\\\\nOkay. And do you sometimes feel concerned about what the future holds for you in this role? Yes, definitely. I definitely think about that. I've brought up that issue in family meetings and other discussions. So, no one is willing to take responsibility. Everyone's busy. Everyone is doing this and that, and it just feels like I have to keep doing this forever. I've declined many professional opportunities. I should have gotten promoted, which is costing me more money and other things. Then, this cake remains a barrier and other obstacles. Thinking about other things, I definitely have thoughts about what the future holds for me in this role. If it continues like this for a long time, I would have declined numerous offers and might still be in the same position for years. I'm hoping very soon that I'll have enough finances.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] We can actually transfer him to a stable, professional home where we have professional caregivers and such. But our greatest hope is that his conditions improve, which would mean fewer hours of caregiving for us. And then, on the days we continue to be caregivers, we'll have fewer hours because he cannot do many things by himself. Doctors assure us that such a possibility is near in the future. We're also hoping that, if that doesn't work out, I won't be considering professional caregiving homes anymore. So that's it about that.\\\\n\\\\nThe truth is, if we could find someone to cover shifts when I'm active for two days a week and he's active for another two days, matching our schedules for another two days, or if I ask for 12 hours a day and he takes the other 12 hours, it would greatly ease my stress and burdens. And then, if we have enough finances, we could move him to a professional place \\u2013 the kind where they don't view it as a task but as their job, having been trained for it. They don't have anything else to stop them from doing their job. I believe those are the two best options.\\\\n\\\\nDefinitely, I think about that solution around 100% of the time.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] First of all, it\\\\'s financial basis, and then we\\\\'ve had a lot of stories about professional caregivers. You know, there have been instances of neglect and terrible happenings. That\\\\'s something he doesn\\\\'t want. He kicks against it. He doesn\\\\'t want it. We\\\\'ve brought up the idea in some meetings where the family is willing to donate and have that done. But he himself doesn\\\\'t want that. He says if we try that and he gets escaped from there, he\\\\'ll run off and do some of those things. You know, it\\\\'s really hard. He doesn\\\\'t want it. And we\\\\'re also concerned about the risk. That\\\\'s why we haven\\\\'t implemented it. He forgets a lot very frequently. Oh, no, he doesn\\\\'t forget me. He knows me, he knows me. But he mostly forgets other family members, not me, not me. And he doesn\\\\'t remember them. Yes, definitely. Like, \\\"What are you?\\\" \\\"What are you looking for?\\\" You know, sometimes it\\\\'s like, \\\"Oh, oh, John, I have a stranger in this house.\\\" It\\\\'s trying to come to the front door, doing this and that. You\\\\'ve had calls like that when my wife was back at her job, and he called me up. \\\"Oh John, I have this woman, a lady at my door. I don\\\\'t know what she\\\\'s looking for. Can you call the cops? Can you do this?\\\" And I\\\\'m like, \\\"It\\\\'s my wife for God\\\\'s sake.\\\" So you have issues like that, but he\\\\'s not aggressive towards them. He just wants to know who is who and what is what. And I\\\\'m sure he\\\\'s safe. I would say he\\\\'s progressing towards neutral.', '\\\\n  [/INST] \\\"Yeah. I don\\\\'t read it; I\\\\'ll read it. Well, I feel I might share my experiences, and I was thinking of possibly sharing some resources that can help me on my caregiving journey. Maybe we can discuss such things during the meeting.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n--End of Response--']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

of his visit to hospital sure i take him there on time im always saying while hes in doctor we are done you know come back home so its just like normal thing you do for your child so it i immediately im responsible for most of things ok someone says that ok well for past few weeks i would say pressure is much more lesser than before then i had you know when we first started it was lot for me to taking balancing being caregiver also having full time job its really really tough its really tough then being at entry level someone with little no you know superiority i have buses which im also under their command you know its really hard to have my wish in time like that so then also its its always very difficult coping with new development you know things your father can do before easily before you find it you say that hes having hard time doing them you always just have to be around ensuring that it does it right so its always very tough to take in its really hard to believe that this is happening so for for past few weeks ice after that im finding it little bit more easier because ive let it become part of me ive let it become something i do you know not because i want to receive award for some you know some people work because they just want to get pay some people do some things because they just want to you know receive profits from it but when you do something because of all of you have for person you dont count it as something that even if its not reciprocated well you dont see it as anything so ive learned to teach myself to do it because i love my father my parents i would im willing to go extra mile to make sure theyre ok theyre fine because theyve also sacrificed lot for me so for past few weeks i have made it my habits you know something i do without being for something i do without seeing it thats hard job though theres lot of challenge definitely lot of challenge tell him something he forgets it easily has few reactions some things you did yesterday you can remember some things you know lot of things lot of challenges but ive learned to just calm down you know sometimes when its overwhelming i just take walk just listen to music just do something to calm me myself down because i cannot be transferring aggression to him i cannot show any sign of no anger any other things because it would really really affect his own wellbeing so i rather would rather take walk on his throat rather just turn my earbuds on listen to loud music just do something to just chill off before i can actually think on what next to do so i would say im really coping nicely im finding strategies to make it much more easier for me so thats how that is ok well relationship with friends family colleagues definitely there is shift i spend more time at home apart from my job apart from my job you know most times then i would love to socialize you know visit friends go to watch game go to at club go to lottery houses you know i spent my most of my free times there my weekends you know im socializing im hanging out im doing lot of stuff sports now i have to spend there with my parents my dad because he needs care everything is getting better though but he needs care so thats affected my relationship with my friends well it makes me my wife have much more time together since im spending more time at home with my father shes always around too so but with my friends thats really severed relationship we do lot of call video calls you know voice calls to kind of compensate for may not being able to show up there sometimes that some occasions will clash with days he has to go to hospital i just have to cancel occasion you know so its really done little to that my friends my colleagues you know my colleague maybe having birthday celebration at his home hes having occasion its classes with sometime by time i have to just be with my dad so most of them do actually understand they understand my situation they dont get annoyed but definitely i would say it has really affected it has made me more introvert no staying indoors just loving things i can do indoors you know i only go out when i have to apart from my job sometimes i take my dad also sees to see game because he loves basketball so we go to watch some basketball sometimes makes him more happy makes him lively you know you see him celebrate him when he sees says he hook he goes cold some other things makes him more lively you know it adds makes health better some other things so thats pretty much how when i go out then relationship with my friends colleagues it has done little damage to it definitely definitely it is it is i it has it is about where its stopping me from going out its making me spend more time at home spend more time with my dad just ensuring that things are going as it should so but i dont see that as you know when you people say barrier you know its something very negative something terrible something you dont want to but it is what it is now im not seeing it as barrier im just saying that is that how can i describe it as alternative you know im learning new way of life instead of being that you know extroverts talk so much going out partying having so much fun spending money wasting money wasting time doing some other things i now taking all those energies transfer it into something useful apart from while im even caregiving i have some remote things i do i trade crypto i do some other things so i want to say its barrier anymore it has taught me how to actually invest in myself do things while im at home so that also helped me in way ok well in my decision making process i think no real change no real change no real change any decision i need to make you know in regards to him sometimes he actually is able to make few decisions sometimes you know explaining some things to him he doesnt understand we write it down let him greet we play it let him listen to it very slowly then if he understands he can make some decisions he makes about of decisions i make about so in regards to him i dont think there is any change in my decision making process then its more than fine i think twice before i make any decisions i compare my alternatives i consider lot of choices before i can actually make decision but as regards myself well some decisions i make as regards my own life i shared this with my wife theres no real need of sharing with my dad because even if i shared with him before tomorrow he forgets something like that so my decisions as regards myself my family i dont really share them with him because he dont really are remembers most of those things few ones that actually you know like maybe ah ohh its your granddaughter birthday its your grandsons birthday something like that ohh its your its your wifes birthday its my birthday you know things like that that theyre just for moment so we share those with him but you know real issues as regarding my decision making process i dont share that with him there is no change you know when you say change in decision making process maybe because im frustrated i make certain decisions because im angry i make certain decisions ive taught myself so much to be able to control all those calm myself down take it through listen to good music do something that just you know its little stressful now then when im come when im settled i can now think my way out of making very good decision because when you make decisions when you are annoyed most times it is end of time there are no good decisions because at that point i wont say youve lost your mind but you are totally out of yourself such situation might be really really terrible have nasty consequences so ive taught myself how to control them yeah that that is definitely true thats definitely true caregiving yes definitely it does affect it affects those decisions you know i before i go for any vacation of stuff i have to plan it very well it sure it doesnt clash with you stuffs especially critical visits to hospitals so i make sure any vacation something doesnt tamper with that well about location i have home here so i dont see any circumstance of me you know moving out of this area for at least for next years so i love this place i settled in i think im doing fine so but if there would be maybe case maybe any circumstance that would actually need relocation movement i think there even would definitely be barrier because we have to actually transfer hospitals then get stable around place where we are feed them with all previous information they need to know then continue doing it there because it definitely is factor i would consider before i make such kinds of huge decisions you know decisions that would really affect him like me going on vacation locating going for holidays somewhere something it is major function that i have to consider ok now commitment page yeah definitely professional commitment yes eversource definitely they have affected some things with us ok yeah self keep practicing yeah manage daily stress describe yourself here properties past weeks might stress of caregiving share strategies ok well selfcare practices like i said sometimes it gets very frustrating you know sometimes some things you tell him you forget its really annoying because sometimes its annoying definitely any normal person will get annoyed with some things like i said in previous recordings i have taught myself to manage these stresses it wasnt days job two years job three years job its been over years now so i go for walk when im having when im feeling stress you know having gone to my full time job makes lot of difficulties stuffs problems every other thing im coming back then i just want peace then im still having lot of things to deal with you know frustration sets in terrible mood swings anger every other thing so i learned to take walk you know once its not that its in critical situation where i need to be there i will just take walk i just go to my music room put on my earbuds listen to music play piano do something that would ease my stress i just even go to sitting room just watch netflix just laugh laugh out sometimes then is stress away so some of strategies have actually been employing sure i go away from that you know i i go away from where he is just try to ease with stress then then sometimes then sometimes i just you know i just try to cope with it i makes decisions not to get annoyed you know some things are supposed to make you annoyed then to see why am i why am i why am i even getting annoyed for no reason listen isnt something much that should get me annoyed then i just flush out thought of being annoyed then take it as something normal so i think those are some of major strategies i have employed as regards coping with daily stresses every other stuff how frequently ill say ill say majorly five days week five days i got my job definitely very stressful well i would say is about him keeping to his routine he knows what he should be doing at this time he knows what he should be doing at that time then you ask him have you done this ohh ive done it then you find out hes not done it ok he has call he has check up call from hospital while im at my job hes not hes not picking them up hes not answering he say oh have you done this say ohh i dont even know that i should have done that then you prepare you want to eat this food then you make it then you bring it he doesnt want to eat it anymore he wants to eat something else you know lot of those things come up those are just few of examples its very stressful very annoying thats fifth one right yeah yeah factors such as professional commitment financial constraints yes our professional commitment definitely you know there was time i should you know have i my company was planning to actually sponsor me on trip to i think to united kingdom you know for seminar some other fellowship then for some other knowledge professional stuffs it was meant to be two weeks then i found way to get someone to stay with him every other thing it just fell apart i wasnt able to go it was really painful at that moment at that moment i you know just had to back out of opportunity that i had been waiting all my life for then it was frustrating terrible well yeah it is what it is i have gotten something close that now so it doesnt pin me so much when i think of it so lot of professional commitments you know sometimes i am supposed to do over some over time just to get some extra cash then i just cant i just have to be dashing out of office money time because i have someone im caregiving you know its really really frustrating then you get home you meet some other stress some other things frustrating so i would say professional commitment care given standards barrier between lot of professional commitments as far as im concerned then financial constraints health challenges well financial constraints for me at this moment well i thank god i think im im im above moderate in very good salary my father also you know hes worked some things down for himself so he has his health insurance some other things that basically covered by job things he has done while he was still active so i dont really have support care about financial stuff it is well available so i wont say financial constraints is really any problem then health changes well sometimes i also fall sick then sick person still caring for sick person so i try my as best as much as i as i can not to fall sick but when i do i well my wife actually takes takes responsibility of doing what ive been doing so i think thats basically it i get distracted get lot of distraction lot lots of distraction you know sometimes he just makes some emergency call then you pick up you be like whats up says i just want to hear your voice you know that would be really annoying like you call me five times just want to hear my voice for what then im just you know i see your call im panicking now maybe something is wrong i just have to pick it up you know sometimes you see your call you know my brain say oh im busy you just shoot them text im busy ill call you later then thats all when you are done with job you call them but you see call you know it you know is someone ok given for so you just have to pick it up then you say ohh i just want to hear your voice why just want to do this then you be like dont call me like this when i see your call i have to pick up because of this that dont just call because when i hear my voice im busy at my job some other things then he doesnt hear he keeps calling so i get distracted lot so but its part of job of caregiving definitely well yes definitely there are some positions i want us to be promoted to but its going to definitely hit hit into time of my care given so ive declined few of those offers then i hope it gets very very much more better soon then i can have less hours care given then maybe take some professional you know promotions no i sleep well i sleep well eat good he sleeps very he sleeps very early he wakes up late so i hardly have any issues at night i sleep well for me for him no no no no none of those ok do you sometimes feel concerned about what future holds for you in room yeah definitely i definitely think about that i definitely think about that ive table that you know in family meetings some other stuff so you know no one is willing to take responsibility everyones busy everyone is doing this that it just feels like i just have to keep doing this forever then i think that well ive actually declined lot of professional things i should have you know gotten promoted getting costing me more money getting me you know some other things then this cake even is staying as barrier some other things you know just thinking about some other things so i definitely have thoughts most of time what future holds for me in this role because if it continues like this for long time you know i would have to decline lot of offers along line i might still be in same position for years so i consider that then im hoping very soon that one actually have enough finances we can actually transfer him to stable you know professional home where we have professional caregivers stuff like that but utmost prayer is that his conditions improve then we actually have less hours of caregiving then we are still caregivers that day but we have less hours because he cannot do many things by himself well doctors are promised that that is possibility in nearest future we are also hoping that god if that is possible but if that doesnt work out then at some point i wont be considering i would be considering professional caregiving homes so i guess thats it about that well truth is if i have someone someone else if we can run something like shift when im active for these two days week then hes active for another two days match for another two days im asking for hours day then he takes other hours you know something like that it would ease me of lot of stress lot of burdens then if possibly if we have enough finances we can just move him to professional place you know those ones they dont see it as task theyve been trained for that then they do it to any living so thats their job they dont have something else to stop in them so i think those might be two great options ok yeah definitely definitely i think about that by percent of time first of all its financial basis then also weve had lot of stories about professional caregivers you know neglect terrible happenings that weve had that doesnt want he he he kicks he kicks against it he doesnt want it weve actually brought up in some meetings where family is willing to donate then get that done but he himself doesnt want that he says if we try that he gets escaped from there hes gonna run off do some of that stuffs you know its really hard he doesnt want it then we also we are concerned about risk so thats why were not really implemented he forgets lot very frequently ohh me no he doesnt forget me he doesnt forget me he knows me he knows me mostly forget some other family members but not not me not me doesnt remember them yeah definitely like oh what are you what are you looking for you know sometimes like oh oh john i have stranger in this house its trying to come to front door doing this that you know ive had calls like that when my wife you know my wife was back at her job then he called me up ohh john i have this woman lady at my door i dont know what shes looking for can you call cops can you do this im like its my wife for gods sake so you have issues like that so but hes not aggressive towards them he just wants to know who is who what is what im sure hes safe i would say progressive out to neutral yeah so i dont read it read it well i feel i might share my experiences then i was thinking maybe there are some resources that can actually help me caregiving journey maybe something like that would also be shared during meeting so those are things im looking for\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

Bonnie. I'm 28 years old. Single. I live with my parents. I stay with my parents, as I do who I am. I give care to them, very well. I am the only caregiver for my mother, who is 56 years old. It's been five years since I've been caring for her.\\\\n\\\\nShare how you have been feeling in the past few weeks while taking care of your loved one with dementia. Tell us about any moment, whether positive or challenging, that stands out to you. It's been a difficult life for me, reducing my participation in studies and other aspects of my life. So the past few weeks have been a challenging time for me.\\\\n\\\\nGoing to parties and school are things I've had to stop. I've stopped going to school to take care of my mother. No positive moments stand out.\\\\n\\\\nIn financial aspects, I don't have any money to continue taking care of her. Cooking for her can be difficult, as she often screams, shouts, and yells. I leave her care to my meter when I can.\\\\n\\\\nRegarding your relationships with family, friends, or anyone online, have there been any changes or shifts? I haven't noticed any changes. My life has been this way for the past five years.\\\\n\\\\nMy family and friends have distanced themselves because I'm taking care of my mother. I'm the only one with her now. No, it doesn't affect me.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] My communication and attention have been divided among my family and friends, as well as my colleagues at school. I've only managed to invite one friend to join me for the past four to five years. Even when I call her, it takes her two to three days to respond. I'm having trouble hearing you. Could you please repeat? I can't hear you. Yes, I believe that's question 3.\\\\n\\\\nMy family and I discussed the other time that my family and friends are no longer with me. They have left me alone. Only one friend remains with whom I can call. She used to take three to four days to come when I called.\\\\n\\\\nOver the past few weeks, you and the kids have not been involved in the engineering process intentionally. I've made some changes in my decision-making process. This is due to the food I eat at home and the financial situation, as well as my mother's sickness. I often think about her and prioritize her needs first.\\\\n\\\\nRegarding question 4, I'd be happy to describe my self-care practices over the past few weeks to manage the daily stresses of caregiving. My strategies for coping with the steady stress of caregiving include:\\\\n\\\\n1. The time I spend cooking for her and taking care of her. This time is dedicated to her care, management, and making her happy.\\\\n2. I engage in social media and surf the internet as a means of rest.\\\\n\\\\n(Note: The original text did not contain a clear question or prompt for response, so I assumed the response should address the general topic of self-care practices and coping strategies for caregiving.)\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] Whenever I take care of us, and I, whenever she is asleep, I used to sleep too. I used to take a rest. My responsibility is to make sure I wake up before she does. I used to sleep very well before and go out, go to schools, go to clubs. I used to party very well, but now I don't do that anymore. I used to drive and just put the car on and go wherever, whenever, wherever I was going. (Pause) I can't hear you. No, nobody is there. It's to go out. I didn't used to leave her at home and go out. I go out with her now. I'll put her inside the car and go out. Nobody is there to stay with her.\\\\n\\\\nIn the past few weeks, earning factors such as professional commitment, financial constraints, and health challenges have influenced how I manage my fees. Based on this, these special therapists used to allow her to come, but now there is no financial support from anyone. So, I had to go and carry out my caregiving duties at the government hospital. (Pause) Yes, there have been no changes because I don't have any money. I'm not financially buoyant now. (Pause) I can't hear you.\\\\n\\\\nYes, my health isn't my home or my mother's health. My health is a concern for me. At least I'm coping a little. I get tired. Stress is too much for me. I get tired every now and then. I'm a caregiver to my mother because I take care of her. I've not seen any support from anyone. I work remotely.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] And I work for her for three hours, and the remaining hours are for taking care of her. No, she's not the one answering me. I'm doing it because of my mother. I'll just make sure that I have given her her drugs, her food, and then I'll start working. It has reduced my wages.\\\\n\\\\nLike, two weeks ago, when I was working, she was awake. I had to stop what I was doing then and attend to her. This has affected me in a lot of ways. What do I do? Ah, I used to give her more than ten hours of care. As a caregiver, do you sometimes feel concerned about what the future holds for you in that role? If so, could you share more about it? What kind of help or support will you need?\\\\n\\\\nThe Economist asks, as a caregiver, do you sometimes feel concerned about the future? What does the future hold for you in that role? If so, yes, because I need a partner. I will still have my husband and get married one day. So I need an assistant. I need a partner too. Yes. No, no, no, no. No.\\\\n\\\\nPlease repeat the question. I can't hear you. Yes. Yes, I'm here. I'm here. I need to dedicate my time to her. I require both her attention and financial support. I can't remember, not really. I can't remember anything now. Like the moment I went to look for some jobs to do, and she needed my attention. So I had to attend to her before going. She can remember me. I show her some old videos of ours, some pictures, and lots more.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] She reacts amazingly. She goes into her room when someone comes in. As she reacts amazingly, sometimes, not every time. No, she doesn't react that way. No, she remembers me. No, she didn't used to allow him to go outside alone, but she did it two times a week. No, it's not him. Stressful.\\\"]\",\n          \"[\\\"\\\\n  [/INST] My name is John Smith. I'm 26 years old. I'm the only child of a person with dementia. Is my father? I'm the major caregiver. I've been doing well with answering question one for the past few weeks, for about 7 to 8 years. He's 57. Why is he this way? It's weak. I'm always with him. He stays with me. We stay together. Before going to my job, I ensure he's fine. I provide every basic thing he needs. He's slowed down with his emails, phone calls, voicemails, and I make sure they're all kept in check. I ensure he's using his medication, which are all set before I go to my job. I call at least twice a day to check on him, to make sure he's doing fine, to ensure he's not having any reactions or side effects to the medication, and to make sure he's resting. One should make sure he's doing the little exercise that's been prepared for him. When I'm back, we go for walks, take a stroll around. We do little exercises together. Sometimes we go to church together. He also eats well, eats fruits, and consumes the necessary things. Those on medication, those little exercises, and the hospital visits are also taken care of. I take him to the hospital on time. It's just like taking care of a normal child. I'm immediately responsible for most of the things.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] \\\"OK, someone says that. Well, for the past few weeks, I would say the pressure is much less than before. I had to acknowledge, when we first started, it was a lot for me to balance being a caregiver and having a full-time job. It\\\\'s really tough. It\\\\'s really tough. And then, being at an entry level, with little or no superiority, I have buses to contend with, which I\\\\'m also under their command. It\\\\'s really hard for me to have my wishes met in a timely manner. So, it\\\\'s always very difficult to cope with new developments. You know, things your father could do before easily, you find him having a hard time doing them, and you always have to be around and ensure that they\\\\'re done right. It\\\\'s always very tough to take in. It\\\\'s really hard to believe that this is happening. So, for the past few weeks, I\\\\'ve found it a little bit easier because I\\\\'ve let it become a part of me. I\\\\'ve let it become something I do, not because I want to receive an award or profits from it, but because I love my father and parents, and I would.\\\"', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] I'm willing to go the extra mile to make sure they're okay. They're fine because they've also sacrificed a lot for me. And so, for the past few weeks, I have made it a habit to do something without seeing it as a chore. That's a hard job, though. There's a lot of challenge, definitely. He forgets things easily and has few reactions. Some things you did yesterday, you can remember some of them. You know, a lot of things, a lot of challenges, but I've learned to just calm down. You know, sometimes when it's overwhelming, I just take a walk. Or just listen to music or just do something to calm myself down because I cannot transfer aggression to him. I cannot show any sign of anger and other things because it would really, really affect his own well-being. So, I rather take a walk or turn on my earbuds and listen to loud music. Or just do something to chill off before I can actually think about what next to do.\\\\n\\\\nSo, I would say I'm really coping nicely and finding strategies to make it much easier for me. So that's how it is.\\\\n\\\\nOK. Well, the relationship with friends, family, and colleagues has definitely shifted. I spend more time at home, apart from my job. Most times, I would love to socialize, you know, visit friends, go to watch a game, go to the club, go to lottery houses, you know.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] I spent most of my free time there. My weekends, you know, I'm socializing. I'm hanging out. I'm doing a lot of stuff. Sports. Now I have to spend time there with my parents, my dad. Because he needs care and everything is getting better, though he needs care. That's affected my relationship with my friends. And well, it makes me and my wife have much more time together since I'm spending more time at home with my father, and she's always around too. So, but with my friends, that's really severed the relationship. We do a lot of call video calls, you know, voice calls to kind of compensate for not being able to show up there. Sometimes, some occasions will clash with the days he has to go to the hospital, and I just have to cancel. The occasion, you know, so it's really done a little to that, my friends, my colleagues, you know, my colleague, maybe. Having a birthday celebration at his home or he's having an occasion, and it clashes with some classes. By the time I have to just be with my dad. So. Most of them do actually understand. They understand my situation, and they don't get annoyed, but definitely, I would say it has really affected me. It has made me more introverted. No staying outdoors. And, just loving things I can do indoors, you know, and I only go out when I have to, apart from my job. Sometimes, I take my dad to see a game because he loves basketball. So, we go to watch some basketball. Sometimes, it makes him happier, makes him livelier.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] You know, you see him celebrating when he sees. Says he, \\\"I hook him.\\\" He goes cold and some other things make him more lively. You know, it adds to making his health better and some other things. So that\\\\'s pretty much how it goes when I go out, and then the relationship with my friends and colleagues has done a little damage to it, definitely. Definitely, it is. It is I who it has stopped. It\\\\'s about where it\\\\'s stopping me from going out and making me spend more time at home, more time with my dad, just ensuring that things are going as they should. But I don\\\\'t see that.\\\\n\\\\nAs you know, when people say barrier, you know it\\\\'s something very negative, something terrible, something you don\\\\'t want. But it is what it is. And now I\\\\'m not seeing it as a barrier. I\\\\'m just saying that\\\\'s how I can describe it as an alternative. You know, I\\\\'m learning a new way of life instead of being the extrovert who talks so much about going out, partying, having so much fun, spending money, wasting money, and wasting time doing other things. Now, I\\\\'m taking all those energies and transferring them into something useful, apart from caregiving. I have some remote things I do, like trading crypto, and I do other things. So I want to say it\\\\'s no longer a barrier. It has taught me how to actually invest in myself and do things while I\\\\'m at home, which also helped me in a way.\\\\n\\\\nOK. Well, in my decision-making process, there\\\\'s no real change, no real change, no real change.', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] Any decision I need to make, in regards to him: Sometimes he's able to make a few decisions, explaining things to him, he doesn't always understand. We write it down or play it slowly and let him greet or listen. If he understands, he can make some decisions. He makes about 50% of decisions, and I make about 50%. Regarding him, there's no change in my decision-making process. I think twice before making any decisions, comparing alternatives, and considering many choices. However, regarding myself and my family, I don't share those decisions with him because he often forgets. For instance, it's your granddaughter's birthday, or it's your grandson's birthday, or it's your wife's birthday, or it's my birthday. We share those with him for the moment. But regarding real issues concerning my decision-making process, I don't share that with him, and there's no change.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] You know, when you say \\\"change in decision-making process,\\\" maybe because I\\\\'m frustrated, I make certain decisions. Or, because I\\\\'m angry, I make certain decisions. I\\\\'ve taught myself to control those, to calm myself down, to think it through, to listen to good music, or do something that helps me relax. When I\\\\'m settled, I can then make a good decision. Decisions made when you\\\\'re annoyed most times are not good, as at that point, you\\\\'re not fully in control of yourself. Such situations can be really terrible and have nasty consequences. I\\\\'ve taught myself how to control them. That\\\\'s definitely true. That\\\\'s definitely true.\\\\n\\\\nCaregiving affects decisions, too. Before I go on any vacation or do anything, I plan it well to ensure it doesn\\\\'t clash with critical hospital visits. I make sure any vacation or something doesn\\\\'t interfere with that.\\\\n\\\\nAs for location, I have a home here, so I don\\\\'t see any circumstances of me moving out of this area for at least the next 10 to 20 years. I\\\\'ve settled in, and I think I\\\\'m doing fine. But,\\\\n\\\\n--End of Response--', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] If there were perhaps a case or any circumstance that would require relocation or movement, I think there would definitely be a barrier. We would have to transfer hospitals and then establish a stable base at the new location. Feed them with all the necessary information and continue doing so there, as this is a significant factor I would consider before making such decisions, which could significantly impact him, such as my going on vacation or relocating somewhere. This is a major function I have to consider.\\\\n\\\\nNow, let's move on to the commitment page. Yes, definitely. Professional commitment, yes. Eversource has indeed affected some things for us.\\\\n\\\\nApril 20, yes. Keep practicing self. Manage daily stress. Describe yourself here, properties, and past weeks. Might the stress of caregiving share strategies?\\\\n\\\\nOK, well, self-care practices. I sometimes find caregiving very frustrating. You know, there are things I tell him that I forget. It can be quite annoying, as even a normal person would get annoyed with some things. I've taught myself to manage these stresses. It wasn't a one-day or two-year job; it's been over seven years now. So, I go for a walk when I'm feeling stressed.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] When I'm feeling stressed, you know, coming home from my full-time job creates a lot of difficulties and problems, and every other thing. And I just want peace. But I'm still dealing with a lot of things, you know, frustration sets in. Terrible mood swings, anger, and every other thing. So I learned to take a walk, you know, not when it's a critical situation where I need to be there. I will just take a walk or go to my music room, put on my earbuds, listen to music or play the piano, or do something that eases my stress. And I just go to the sitting room and watch Netflix. I just laugh, sometimes out loud, and then the stress is away. Some of the strategies I have employed to cope with daily stresses and every other thing are:\\\\n\\\\n1. Taking a walk\\\\n2. Going to the music room\\\\n3. Watching Netflix\\\\n4. Employing strategies to cope with stress\\\\n\\\\nI employ these strategies frequently, about five days a week.\\\\n\\\\nI try to make decisions not to get annoyed. You know, some things are supposed to make you annoyed, and then I just flush out the thought of being annoyed and take it as something normal. So, these are some of the major strategies I have employed as regards coping with daily stresses.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] The five days I received the job offer. Definitely very stressful. Well, I\\\\'d say that\\\\'s about him sticking to his routine. He knows what he should be doing at this time. He knows what he should be doing at that time. And then you ask him, \\\"Have you done this?\\\" \\\"Ohh, I\\\\'ve done it.\\\" But then you find out he hasn\\\\'t, okay. He has a call. He has a check-up call from the hospital while I\\\\'m at my job. And he\\\\'s not answering. He says, \\\"Oh, have you done this?\\\" and then says, \\\"Ohh, I don\\\\'t even know. I should have done that.\\\" You prepare. You want to eat this food and then make it, and then bring it, but he doesn\\\\'t want to eat it anymore. He wants to eat something else. A lot of those things come up. Those are just a few examples, and it\\\\'s very stressful and very annoying. That\\\\'s the fifth one, right? Yeah. Yeah, factors such as professional commitment and financial constraints, yes. Our professional commitment, definitely. There was a time I should have gone. You know, my company was planning to sponsor me on a trip to the United Kingdom for a seminar and some other fellowship, as well as some other knowledge and professional stuffs. It was meant to be a two-week trip. But I found a way to get someone to stay with him, and it all fell apart. I wasn\\\\'t able to go. It was really painful at that moment.', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] At that moment, I had to back out of the opportunity I had been waiting for all my life. It was frustrating and terrible. Well, yes, it is what it is. I have gotten something close, but it doesn't pin me down as much. And when I think of it, I'm supposed to do overtime sometimes just to get some extra cash, but I just can't. I have to dash out of the office on time because I have someone I'm caregiving for. I'm a caregiver, you know. It's really frustrating. And then you get home and meet other stresses and things. It's frustrating. So, professional commitments are a barrier for me, as far as I'm concerned, then financial constraints or health challenges. Well, financial constraints aren't really a problem for me at this moment. I'm above moderate and have a very good salary. My father, you know, he's worked things out for himself. So he has health insurance and other things covered by the job. So I don't really have to worry about financial stuff. It's all available. I wouldn't say financial constraints are a problem. Then there are health changes. Well, I sometimes fall sick and the sick person is still caring for a sick person. So I try my best not to fall sick.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] But when I do well, my wife actually takes the responsibility for doing what I\\\\'ve been doing. So I think that\\\\'s basically it. I get distracted. I get a lot of distraction, a lot, lots of distraction. You know, sometimes he just makes some emergency calls and then you pick up. \\\"What\\\\'s up?\\\" he says, and that would be really annoying. Like you call me five times and just want to hear my voice for what? And then I\\\\'m just, you know, I see your call. I\\\\'m panicking now. Maybe something is wrong and I just have to pick it up. You know, sometimes you see your call. Your brain says, \\\"I\\\\'m busy,\\\" or you just shoot them a text. \\\"I\\\\'m busy. I\\\\'ll call you later.\\\" And then that\\\\'s all.\\\\n\\\\nAnd when you\\\\'re done with your job, you call them. But you see the call. You know, it\\\\'s given for. So you just have to pick it up and then you say, \\\"Ohh, I just want to hear your voice.\\\" Why just want to do this and then you be like, \\\"Don\\\\'t call me.\\\" I have to pick up because of this and that. Don\\\\'t just call, because when I hear my voice, I\\\\'m busy at my job and with other things, and then he doesn\\\\'t hear and he keeps calling. So I get distracted a lot.\\\\n\\\\nBut it\\\\'s part of the job of caregiving, definitely. Well, yes, definitely. There are some positions we want to be promoted to, but it\\\\'s going to hit hard into the time of my caregiving. So I\\\\'ve declined a few of those offers.', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] And then I hope it gets much, much better soon, so I can have fewer hours of care given, and perhaps take some professional promotions. No, I sleep well. I sleep well. He sleeps very well and wakes up early, so I have few issues. At night, I sleep well. For me, or for him? No, no, no, no, none of those.\\\\n\\\\nOkay. And do you sometimes feel concerned about what the future holds for you in this role? Yes, definitely. I definitely think about that. I've brought up that issue in family meetings and other discussions. So, no one is willing to take responsibility. Everyone's busy. Everyone is doing this and that, and it just feels like I have to keep doing this forever. I've declined many professional opportunities. I should have gotten promoted, which is costing me more money and other things. Then, this cake remains a barrier and other obstacles. Thinking about other things, I definitely have thoughts about what the future holds for me in this role. If it continues like this for a long time, I would have declined numerous offers and might still be in the same position for years. I'm hoping very soon that I'll have enough finances.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] We can actually transfer him to a stable, professional home where we have professional caregivers and such. But our greatest hope is that his conditions improve, which would mean fewer hours of caregiving for us. And then, on the days we continue to be caregivers, we'll have fewer hours because he cannot do many things by himself. Doctors assure us that such a possibility is near in the future. We're also hoping that, if that doesn't work out, I won't be considering professional caregiving homes anymore. So that's it about that.\\\\n\\\\nThe truth is, if we could find someone to cover shifts when I'm active for two days a week and he's active for another two days, matching our schedules for another two days, or if I ask for 12 hours a day and he takes the other 12 hours, it would greatly ease my stress and burdens. And then, if we have enough finances, we could move him to a professional place \\u2013 the kind where they don't view it as a task but as their job, having been trained for it. They don't have anything else to stop them from doing their job. I believe those are the two best options.\\\\n\\\\nDefinitely, I think about that solution around 100% of the time.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] First of all, it\\\\'s financial basis, and then we\\\\'ve had a lot of stories about professional caregivers. You know, there have been instances of neglect and terrible happenings. That\\\\'s something he doesn\\\\'t want. He kicks against it. He doesn\\\\'t want it. We\\\\'ve brought up the idea in some meetings where the family is willing to donate and have that done. But he himself doesn\\\\'t want that. He says if we try that and he gets escaped from there, he\\\\'ll run off and do some of those things. You know, it\\\\'s really hard. He doesn\\\\'t want it. And we\\\\'re also concerned about the risk. That\\\\'s why we haven\\\\'t implemented it. He forgets a lot very frequently. Oh, no, he doesn\\\\'t forget me. He knows me, he knows me. But he mostly forgets other family members, not me, not me. And he doesn\\\\'t remember them. Yes, definitely. Like, \\\"What are you?\\\" \\\"What are you looking for?\\\" You know, sometimes it\\\\'s like, \\\"Oh, oh, John, I have a stranger in this house.\\\" It\\\\'s trying to come to the front door, doing this and that. You\\\\'ve had calls like that when my wife was back at her job, and he called me up. \\\"Oh John, I have this woman, a lady at my door. I don\\\\'t know what she\\\\'s looking for. Can you call the cops? Can you do this?\\\" And I\\\\'m like, \\\"It\\\\'s my wife for God\\\\'s sake.\\\" So you have issues like that, but he\\\\'s not aggressive towards them. He just wants to know who is who and what is what. And I\\\\'m sure he\\\\'s safe. I would say he\\\\'s progressing towards neutral.', '\\\\n  [/INST] \\\"Yeah. I don\\\\'t read it; I\\\\'ll read it. Well, I feel I might share my experiences, and I was thinking of possibly sharing some resources that can help me on my caregiving journey. Maybe we can discuss such things during the meeting.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n--End of Response--']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

i dont used to allow her to go outside alone two times in week no no not him stressful\",\n          \"ok my name is yeah my name is john smith i am years old i am child to you know person with dementia is my father ok im only one who is major caregiver ok answering question one well for past few weeks yeah its about years to years hes why so weak yeah im im always with him he stays with me we stay together so before going to my job i ensure hes fine i provide every basic things he needs you know he slowed his his emails his phone calls voicemails he has sure everything are kept in check sure hes using his medication they are all set before i go to my job at my job i always calling i calling at least twice to check on him to make sure hes doing fine make sure hes not having any reaction side effects to medication make sure hes resting one is supposed to make sure hes doing little exercise that has been prepared for him you know when im back also i take him we go for walk take stroll around we do little exercise sometimes we go to church together there sure he also eats well eat fruits eats necessary things those use medication those little exercise then also on days of his visit to hospital sure i take him there on time im always saying while hes in doctor we are done you know come back home so its just like normal thing you do for your child so it i immediately im responsible for most of things ok someone says that ok well for past few weeks i would say pressure is much more lesser than before then i had you know when we first started it was lot for me to taking balancing being caregiver also having full time job its really really tough its really tough then being at entry level someone with little no you know superiority i have buses which im also under their command you know its really hard to have my wish in time like that so then also its its always very difficult coping with new development you know things your father can do before easily before you find it you say that hes having hard time doing them you always just have to be around ensuring that it does it right so its always very tough to take in its really hard to believe that this is happening so for for past few weeks ice after that im finding it little bit more easier because ive let it become part of me ive let it become something i do you know not because i want to receive award for some you know some people work because they just want to get pay some people do some things because they just want to you know receive profits from it but when you do something because of all of you have for person you dont count it as something that even if its not reciprocated well you dont see it as anything so ive learned to teach myself to do it because i love my father my parents i would im willing to go extra mile to make sure theyre ok theyre fine because theyve also sacrificed lot for me so for past few weeks i have made it my habits you know something i do without being for something i do without seeing it thats hard job though theres lot of challenge definitely lot of challenge tell him something he forgets it easily has few reactions some things you did yesterday you can remember some things you know lot of things lot of challenges but ive learned to just calm down you know sometimes when its overwhelming i just take walk just listen to music just do something to calm me myself down because i cannot be transferring aggression to him i cannot show any sign of no anger any other things because it would really really affect his own wellbeing so i rather would rather take walk on his throat rather just turn my earbuds on listen to loud music just do something to just chill off before i can actually think on what next to do so i would say im really coping nicely im finding strategies to make it much more easier for me so thats how that is ok well relationship with friends family colleagues definitely there is shift i spend more time at home apart from my job apart from my job you know most times then i would love to socialize you know visit friends go to watch game go to at club go to lottery houses you know i spent my most of my free times there my weekends you know im socializing im hanging out im doing lot of stuff sports now i have to spend there with my parents my dad because he needs care everything is getting better though but he needs care so thats affected my relationship with my friends well it makes me my wife have much more time together since im spending more time at home with my father shes always around too so but with my friends thats really severed relationship we do lot of call video calls you know voice calls to kind of compensate for may not being able to show up there sometimes that some occasions will clash with days he has to go to hospital i just have to cancel occasion you know so its really done little to that my friends my colleagues you know my colleague maybe having birthday celebration at his home hes having occasion its classes with sometime by time i have to just be with my dad so most of them do actually understand they understand my situation they dont get annoyed but definitely i would say it has really affected it has made me more introvert no staying indoors just loving things i can do indoors you know i only go out when i have to apart from my job sometimes i take my dad also sees to see game because he loves basketball so we go to watch some basketball sometimes makes him more happy makes him lively you know you see him celebrate him when he sees says he hook he goes cold some other things makes him more lively you know it adds makes health better some other things so thats pretty much how when i go out then relationship with my friends colleagues it has done little damage to it definitely definitely it is it is i it has it is about where its stopping me from going out its making me spend more time at home spend more time with my dad just ensuring that things are going as it should so but i dont see that as you know when you people say barrier you know its something very negative something terrible something you dont want to but it is what it is now im not seeing it as barrier im just saying that is that how can i describe it as alternative you know im learning new way of life instead of being that you know extroverts talk so much going out partying having so much fun spending money wasting money wasting time doing some other things i now taking all those energies transfer it into something useful apart from while im even caregiving i have some remote things i do i trade crypto i do some other things so i want to say its barrier anymore it has taught me how to actually invest in myself do things while im at home so that also helped me in way ok well in my decision making process i think no real change no real change no real change any decision i need to make you know in regards to him sometimes he actually is able to make few decisions sometimes you know explaining some things to him he doesnt understand we write it down let him greet we play it let him listen to it very slowly then if he understands he can make some decisions he makes about of decisions i make about so in regards to him i dont think there is any change in my decision making process then its more than fine i think twice before i make any decisions i compare my alternatives i consider lot of choices before i can actually make decision but as regards myself well some decisions i make as regards my own life i shared this with my wife theres no real need of sharing with my dad because even if i shared with him before tomorrow he forgets something like that so my decisions as regards myself my family i dont really share them with him because he dont really are remembers most of those things few ones that actually you know like maybe ah ohh its your granddaughter birthday its your grandsons birthday something like that ohh its your its your wifes birthday its my birthday you know things like that that theyre just for moment so we share those with him but you know real issues as regarding my decision making process i dont share that with him there is no change you know when you say change in decision making process maybe because im frustrated i make certain decisions because im angry i make certain decisions ive taught myself so much to be able to control all those calm myself down take it through listen to good music do something that just you know its little stressful now then when im come when im settled i can now think my way out of making very good decision because when you make decisions when you are annoyed most times it is end of time there are no good decisions because at that point i wont say youve lost your mind but you are totally out of yourself such situation might be really really terrible have nasty consequences so ive taught myself how to control them yeah that that is definitely true thats definitely true caregiving yes definitely it does affect it affects those decisions you know i before i go for any vacation of stuff i have to plan it very well it sure it doesnt clash with you stuffs especially critical visits to hospitals so i make sure any vacation something doesnt tamper with that well about location i have home here so i dont see any circumstance of me you know moving out of this area for at least for next years so i love this place i settled in i think im doing fine so but if there would be maybe case maybe any circumstance that would actually need relocation movement i think there even would definitely be barrier because we have to actually transfer hospitals then get stable around place where we are feed them with all previous information they need to know then continue doing it there because it definitely is factor i would consider before i make such kinds of huge decisions you know decisions that would really affect him like me going on vacation locating going for holidays somewhere something it is major function that i have to consider ok now commitment page yeah definitely professional commitment yes eversource definitely they have affected some things with us ok yeah self keep practicing yeah manage daily stress describe yourself here properties past weeks might stress of caregiving share strategies ok well selfcare practices like i said sometimes it gets very frustrating you know sometimes some things you tell him you forget its really annoying because sometimes its annoying definitely any normal person will get annoyed with some things like i said in previous recordings i have taught myself to manage these stresses it wasnt days job two years job three years job its been over years now so i go for walk when im having when im feeling stress you know having gone to my full time job makes lot of difficulties stuffs problems every other thing im coming back then i just want peace then im still having lot of things to deal with you know frustration sets in terrible mood swings anger every other thing so i learned to take walk you know once its not that its in critical situation where i need to be there i will just take walk i just go to my music room put on my earbuds listen to music play piano do something that would ease my stress i just even go to sitting room just watch netflix just laugh laugh out sometimes then is stress away so some of strategies have actually been employing sure i go away from that you know i i go away from where he is just try to ease with stress then then sometimes then sometimes i just you know i just try to cope with it i makes decisions not to get annoyed you know some things are supposed to make you annoyed then to see why am i why am i why am i even getting annoyed for no reason listen isnt something much that should get me annoyed then i just flush out thought of being annoyed then take it as something normal so i think those are some of major strategies i have employed as regards coping with daily stresses every other stuff how frequently ill say ill say majorly five days week five days i got my job definitely very stressful well i would say is about him keeping to his routine he knows what he should be doing at this time he knows what he should be doing at that time then you ask him have you done this ohh ive done it then you find out hes not done it ok he has call he has check up call from hospital while im at my job hes not hes not picking them up hes not answering he say oh have you done this say ohh i dont even know that i should have done that then you prepare you want to eat this food then you make it then you bring it he doesnt want to eat it anymore he wants to eat something else you know lot of those things come up those are just few of examples its very stressful very annoying thats fifth one right yeah yeah factors such as professional commitment financial constraints yes our professional commitment definitely you know there was time i should you know have i my company was planning to actually sponsor me on trip to i think to united kingdom you know for seminar some other fellowship then for some other knowledge professional stuffs it was meant to be two weeks then i found way to get someone to stay with him every other thing it just fell apart i wasnt able to go it was really painful at that moment at that moment i you know just had to back out of opportunity that i had been waiting all my life for then it was frustrating terrible well yeah it is what it is i have gotten something close that now so it doesnt pin me so much when i think of it so lot of professional commitments you know sometimes i am supposed to do over some over time just to get some extra cash then i just cant i just have to be dashing out of office money time because i have someone im caregiving you know its really really frustrating then you get home you meet some other stress some other things frustrating so i would say professional commitment care given standards barrier between lot of professional commitments as far as im concerned then financial constraints health challenges well financial constraints for me at this moment well i thank god i think im im im above moderate in very good salary my father also you know hes worked some things down for himself so he has his health insurance some other things that basically covered by job things he has done while he was still active so i dont really have support care about financial stuff it is well available so i wont say financial constraints is really any problem then health changes well sometimes i also fall sick then sick person still caring for sick person so i try my as best as much as i as i can not to fall sick but when i do i well my wife actually takes takes responsibility of doing what ive been doing so i think thats basically it i get distracted get lot of distraction lot lots of distraction you know sometimes he just makes some emergency call then you pick up you be like whats up says i just want to hear your voice you know that would be really annoying like you call me five times just want to hear my voice for what then im just you know i see your call im panicking now maybe something is wrong i just have to pick it up you know sometimes you see your call you know my brain say oh im busy you just shoot them text im busy ill call you later then thats all when you are done with job you call them but you see call you know it you know is someone ok given for so you just have to pick it up then you say ohh i just want to hear your voice why just want to do this then you be like dont call me like this when i see your call i have to pick up because of this that dont just call because when i hear my voice im busy at my job some other things then he doesnt hear he keeps calling so i get distracted lot so but its part of job of caregiving definitely well yes definitely there are some positions i want us to be promoted to but its going to definitely hit hit into time of my care given so ive declined few of those offers then i hope it gets very very much more better soon then i can have less hours care given then maybe take some professional you know promotions no i sleep well i sleep well eat good he sleeps very he sleeps very early he wakes up late so i hardly have any issues at night i sleep well for me for him no no no no none of those ok do you sometimes feel concerned about what future holds for you in room yeah definitely i definitely think about that i definitely think about that ive table that you know in family meetings some other stuff so you know no one is willing to take responsibility everyones busy everyone is doing this that it just feels like i just have to keep doing this forever then i think that well ive actually declined lot of professional things i should have you know gotten promoted getting costing me more money getting me you know some other things then this cake even is staying as barrier some other things you know just thinking about some other things so i definitely have thoughts most of time what future holds for me in this role because if it continues like this for long time you know i would have to decline lot of offers along line i might still be in same position for years so i consider that then im hoping very soon that one actually have enough finances we can actually transfer him to stable you know professional home where we have professional caregivers stuff like that but utmost prayer is that his conditions improve then we actually have less hours of caregiving then we are still caregivers that day but we have less hours because he cannot do many things by himself well doctors are promised that that is possibility in nearest future we are also hoping that god if that is possible but if that doesnt work out then at some point i wont be considering i would be considering professional caregiving homes so i guess thats it about that well truth is if i have someone someone else if we can run something like shift when im active for these two days week then hes active for another two days match for another two days im asking for hours day then he takes other hours you know something like that it would ease me of lot of stress lot of burdens then if possibly if we have enough finances we can just move him to professional place you know those ones they dont see it as task theyve been trained for that then they do it to any living so thats their job they dont have something else to stop in them so i think those might be two great options ok yeah definitely definitely i think about that by percent of time first of all its financial basis then also weve had lot of stories about professional caregivers you know neglect terrible happenings that weve had that doesnt want he he he kicks he kicks against it he doesnt want it weve actually brought up in some meetings where family is willing to donate then get that done but he himself doesnt want that he says if we try that he gets escaped from there hes gonna run off do some of that stuffs you know its really hard he doesnt want it then we also we are concerned about risk so thats why were not really implemented he forgets lot very frequently ohh me no he doesnt forget me he doesnt forget me he knows me he knows me mostly forget some other family members but not not me not me doesnt remember them yeah definitely like oh what are you what are you looking for you know sometimes like oh oh john i have stranger in this house its trying to come to front door doing this that you know ive had calls like that when my wife you know my wife was back at her job then he called me up ohh john i have this woman lady at my door i dont know what shes looking for can you call cops can you do this im like its my wife for gods sake so you have issues like that so but hes not aggressive towards them he just wants to know who is who what is what im sure hes safe i would say progressive out to neutral yeah so i dont read it read it well i feel i might share my experiences then i was thinking maybe there are some resources that can actually help me caregiving journey maybe something like that would also be shared during meeting so those are things im looking for\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

Bonnie. I'm 28 years old. Single. I live with my parents. I stay with my parents, as I do who I am. I give care to them, very well. I am the only caregiver for my mother, who is 56 years old. It's been five years since I've been caring for her.\\\\n\\\\nShare how you have been feeling in the past few weeks while taking care of your loved one with dementia. Tell us about any moment, whether positive or challenging, that stands out to you. It's been a difficult life for me, reducing my participation in studies and other aspects of my life. So the past few weeks have been a challenging time for me.\\\\n\\\\nGoing to parties and school are things I've had to stop. I've stopped going to school to take care of my mother. No positive moments stand out.\\\\n\\\\nIn financial aspects, I don't have any money to continue taking care of her. Cooking for her can be difficult, as she often screams, shouts, and yells. I leave her care to my meter when I can.\\\\n\\\\nRegarding your relationships with family, friends, or anyone online, have there been any changes or shifts? I haven't noticed any changes. My life has been this way for the past five years.\\\\n\\\\nMy family and friends have distanced themselves because I'm taking care of my mother. I'm the only one with her now. No, it doesn't affect me.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] My communication and attention have been divided among my family and friends, as well as my colleagues at school. I've only managed to invite one friend to join me for the past four to five years. Even when I call her, it takes her two to three days to respond. I'm having trouble hearing you. Could you please repeat? I can't hear you. Yes, I believe that's question 3.\\\\n\\\\nMy family and I discussed the other time that my family and friends are no longer with me. They have left me alone. Only one friend remains with whom I can call. She used to take three to four days to come when I called.\\\\n\\\\nOver the past few weeks, you and the kids have not been involved in the engineering process intentionally. I've made some changes in my decision-making process. This is due to the food I eat at home and the financial situation, as well as my mother's sickness. I often think about her and prioritize her needs first.\\\\n\\\\nRegarding question 4, I'd be happy to describe my self-care practices over the past few weeks to manage the daily stresses of caregiving. My strategies for coping with the steady stress of caregiving include:\\\\n\\\\n1. The time I spend cooking for her and taking care of her. This time is dedicated to her care, management, and making her happy.\\\\n2. I engage in social media and surf the internet as a means of rest.\\\\n\\\\n(Note: The original text did not contain a clear question or prompt for response, so I assumed the response should address the general topic of self-care practices and coping strategies for caregiving.)\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] Whenever I take care of us, and I, whenever she is asleep, I used to sleep too. I used to take a rest. My responsibility is to make sure I wake up before she does. I used to sleep very well before and go out, go to schools, go to clubs. I used to party very well, but now I don't do that anymore. I used to drive and just put the car on and go wherever, whenever, wherever I was going. (Pause) I can't hear you. No, nobody is there. It's to go out. I didn't used to leave her at home and go out. I go out with her now. I'll put her inside the car and go out. Nobody is there to stay with her.\\\\n\\\\nIn the past few weeks, earning factors such as professional commitment, financial constraints, and health challenges have influenced how I manage my fees. Based on this, these special therapists used to allow her to come, but now there is no financial support from anyone. So, I had to go and carry out my caregiving duties at the government hospital. (Pause) Yes, there have been no changes because I don't have any money. I'm not financially buoyant now. (Pause) I can't hear you.\\\\n\\\\nYes, my health isn't my home or my mother's health. My health is a concern for me. At least I'm coping a little. I get tired. Stress is too much for me. I get tired every now and then. I'm a caregiver to my mother because I take care of her. I've not seen any support from anyone. I work remotely.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] And I work for her for three hours, and the remaining hours are for taking care of her. No, she's not the one answering me. I'm doing it because of my mother. I'll just make sure that I have given her her drugs, her food, and then I'll start working. It has reduced my wages.\\\\n\\\\nLike, two weeks ago, when I was working, she was awake. I had to stop what I was doing then and attend to her. This has affected me in a lot of ways. What do I do? Ah, I used to give her more than ten hours of care. As a caregiver, do you sometimes feel concerned about what the future holds for you in that role? If so, could you share more about it? What kind of help or support will you need?\\\\n\\\\nThe Economist asks, as a caregiver, do you sometimes feel concerned about the future? What does the future hold for you in that role? If so, yes, because I need a partner. I will still have my husband and get married one day. So I need an assistant. I need a partner too. Yes. No, no, no, no. No.\\\\n\\\\nPlease repeat the question. I can't hear you. Yes. Yes, I'm here. I'm here. I need to dedicate my time to her. I require both her attention and financial support. I can't remember, not really. I can't remember anything now. Like the moment I went to look for some jobs to do, and she needed my attention. So I had to attend to her before going. She can remember me. I show her some old videos of ours, some pictures, and lots more.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] She reacts amazingly. She goes into her room when someone comes in. As she reacts amazingly, sometimes, not every time. No, she doesn't react that way. No, she remembers me. No, she didn't used to allow him to go outside alone, but she did it two times a week. No, it's not him. Stressful.\\\"]\",\n          \"[\\\"\\\\n  [/INST] My name is John Smith. I'm 26 years old. I'm the only child of a person with dementia. Is my father? I'm the major caregiver. I've been doing well with answering question one for the past few weeks, for about 7 to 8 years. He's 57. Why is he this way? It's weak. I'm always with him. He stays with me. We stay together. Before going to my job, I ensure he's fine. I provide every basic thing he needs. He's slowed down with his emails, phone calls, voicemails, and I make sure they're all kept in check. I ensure he's using his medication, which are all set before I go to my job. I call at least twice a day to check on him, to make sure he's doing fine, to ensure he's not having any reactions or side effects to the medication, and to make sure he's resting. One should make sure he's doing the little exercise that's been prepared for him. When I'm back, we go for walks, take a stroll around. We do little exercises together. Sometimes we go to church together. He also eats well, eats fruits, and consumes the necessary things. Those on medication, those little exercises, and the hospital visits are also taken care of. I take him to the hospital on time. It's just like taking care of a normal child. I'm immediately responsible for most of the things.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] \\\"OK, someone says that. Well, for the past few weeks, I would say the pressure is much less than before. I had to acknowledge, when we first started, it was a lot for me to balance being a caregiver and having a full-time job. It\\\\'s really tough. It\\\\'s really tough. And then, being at an entry level, with little or no superiority, I have buses to contend with, which I\\\\'m also under their command. It\\\\'s really hard for me to have my wishes met in a timely manner. So, it\\\\'s always very difficult to cope with new developments. You know, things your father could do before easily, you find him having a hard time doing them, and you always have to be around and ensure that they\\\\'re done right. It\\\\'s always very tough to take in. It\\\\'s really hard to believe that this is happening. So, for the past few weeks, I\\\\'ve found it a little bit easier because I\\\\'ve let it become a part of me. I\\\\'ve let it become something I do, not because I want to receive an award or profits from it, but because I love my father and parents, and I would.\\\"', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] I'm willing to go the extra mile to make sure they're okay. They're fine because they've also sacrificed a lot for me. And so, for the past few weeks, I have made it a habit to do something without seeing it as a chore. That's a hard job, though. There's a lot of challenge, definitely. He forgets things easily and has few reactions. Some things you did yesterday, you can remember some of them. You know, a lot of things, a lot of challenges, but I've learned to just calm down. You know, sometimes when it's overwhelming, I just take a walk. Or just listen to music or just do something to calm myself down because I cannot transfer aggression to him. I cannot show any sign of anger and other things because it would really, really affect his own well-being. So, I rather take a walk or turn on my earbuds and listen to loud music. Or just do something to chill off before I can actually think about what next to do.\\\\n\\\\nSo, I would say I'm really coping nicely and finding strategies to make it much easier for me. So that's how it is.\\\\n\\\\nOK. Well, the relationship with friends, family, and colleagues has definitely shifted. I spend more time at home, apart from my job. Most times, I would love to socialize, you know, visit friends, go to watch a game, go to the club, go to lottery houses, you know.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] I spent most of my free time there. My weekends, you know, I'm socializing. I'm hanging out. I'm doing a lot of stuff. Sports. Now I have to spend time there with my parents, my dad. Because he needs care and everything is getting better, though he needs care. That's affected my relationship with my friends. And well, it makes me and my wife have much more time together since I'm spending more time at home with my father, and she's always around too. So, but with my friends, that's really severed the relationship. We do a lot of call video calls, you know, voice calls to kind of compensate for not being able to show up there. Sometimes, some occasions will clash with the days he has to go to the hospital, and I just have to cancel. The occasion, you know, so it's really done a little to that, my friends, my colleagues, you know, my colleague, maybe. Having a birthday celebration at his home or he's having an occasion, and it clashes with some classes. By the time I have to just be with my dad. So. Most of them do actually understand. They understand my situation, and they don't get annoyed, but definitely, I would say it has really affected me. It has made me more introverted. No staying outdoors. And, just loving things I can do indoors, you know, and I only go out when I have to, apart from my job. Sometimes, I take my dad to see a game because he loves basketball. So, we go to watch some basketball. Sometimes, it makes him happier, makes him livelier.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] You know, you see him celebrating when he sees. Says he, \\\"I hook him.\\\" He goes cold and some other things make him more lively. You know, it adds to making his health better and some other things. So that\\\\'s pretty much how it goes when I go out, and then the relationship with my friends and colleagues has done a little damage to it, definitely. Definitely, it is. It is I who it has stopped. It\\\\'s about where it\\\\'s stopping me from going out and making me spend more time at home, more time with my dad, just ensuring that things are going as they should. But I don\\\\'t see that.\\\\n\\\\nAs you know, when people say barrier, you know it\\\\'s something very negative, something terrible, something you don\\\\'t want. But it is what it is. And now I\\\\'m not seeing it as a barrier. I\\\\'m just saying that\\\\'s how I can describe it as an alternative. You know, I\\\\'m learning a new way of life instead of being the extrovert who talks so much about going out, partying, having so much fun, spending money, wasting money, and wasting time doing other things. Now, I\\\\'m taking all those energies and transferring them into something useful, apart from caregiving. I have some remote things I do, like trading crypto, and I do other things. So I want to say it\\\\'s no longer a barrier. It has taught me how to actually invest in myself and do things while I\\\\'m at home, which also helped me in a way.\\\\n\\\\nOK. Well, in my decision-making process, there\\\\'s no real change, no real change, no real change.', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] Any decision I need to make, in regards to him: Sometimes he's able to make a few decisions, explaining things to him, he doesn't always understand. We write it down or play it slowly and let him greet or listen. If he understands, he can make some decisions. He makes about 50% of decisions, and I make about 50%. Regarding him, there's no change in my decision-making process. I think twice before making any decisions, comparing alternatives, and considering many choices. However, regarding myself and my family, I don't share those decisions with him because he often forgets. For instance, it's your granddaughter's birthday, or it's your grandson's birthday, or it's your wife's birthday, or it's my birthday. We share those with him for the moment. But regarding real issues concerning my decision-making process, I don't share that with him, and there's no change.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] You know, when you say \\\"change in decision-making process,\\\" maybe because I\\\\'m frustrated, I make certain decisions. Or, because I\\\\'m angry, I make certain decisions. I\\\\'ve taught myself to control those, to calm myself down, to think it through, to listen to good music, or do something that helps me relax. When I\\\\'m settled, I can then make a good decision. Decisions made when you\\\\'re annoyed most times are not good, as at that point, you\\\\'re not fully in control of yourself. Such situations can be really terrible and have nasty consequences. I\\\\'ve taught myself how to control them. That\\\\'s definitely true. That\\\\'s definitely true.\\\\n\\\\nCaregiving affects decisions, too. Before I go on any vacation or do anything, I plan it well to ensure it doesn\\\\'t clash with critical hospital visits. I make sure any vacation or something doesn\\\\'t interfere with that.\\\\n\\\\nAs for location, I have a home here, so I don\\\\'t see any circumstances of me moving out of this area for at least the next 10 to 20 years. I\\\\'ve settled in, and I think I\\\\'m doing fine. But,\\\\n\\\\n--End of Response--', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] If there were perhaps a case or any circumstance that would require relocation or movement, I think there would definitely be a barrier. We would have to transfer hospitals and then establish a stable base at the new location. Feed them with all the necessary information and continue doing so there, as this is a significant factor I would consider before making such decisions, which could significantly impact him, such as my going on vacation or relocating somewhere. This is a major function I have to consider.\\\\n\\\\nNow, let's move on to the commitment page. Yes, definitely. Professional commitment, yes. Eversource has indeed affected some things for us.\\\\n\\\\nApril 20, yes. Keep practicing self. Manage daily stress. Describe yourself here, properties, and past weeks. Might the stress of caregiving share strategies?\\\\n\\\\nOK, well, self-care practices. I sometimes find caregiving very frustrating. You know, there are things I tell him that I forget. It can be quite annoying, as even a normal person would get annoyed with some things. I've taught myself to manage these stresses. It wasn't a one-day or two-year job; it's been over seven years now. So, I go for a walk when I'm feeling stressed.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] When I'm feeling stressed, you know, coming home from my full-time job creates a lot of difficulties and problems, and every other thing. And I just want peace. But I'm still dealing with a lot of things, you know, frustration sets in. Terrible mood swings, anger, and every other thing. So I learned to take a walk, you know, not when it's a critical situation where I need to be there. I will just take a walk or go to my music room, put on my earbuds, listen to music or play the piano, or do something that eases my stress. And I just go to the sitting room and watch Netflix. I just laugh, sometimes out loud, and then the stress is away. Some of the strategies I have employed to cope with daily stresses and every other thing are:\\\\n\\\\n1. Taking a walk\\\\n2. Going to the music room\\\\n3. Watching Netflix\\\\n4. Employing strategies to cope with stress\\\\n\\\\nI employ these strategies frequently, about five days a week.\\\\n\\\\nI try to make decisions not to get annoyed. You know, some things are supposed to make you annoyed, and then I just flush out the thought of being annoyed and take it as something normal. So, these are some of the major strategies I have employed as regards coping with daily stresses.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] The five days I received the job offer. Definitely very stressful. Well, I\\\\'d say that\\\\'s about him sticking to his routine. He knows what he should be doing at this time. He knows what he should be doing at that time. And then you ask him, \\\"Have you done this?\\\" \\\"Ohh, I\\\\'ve done it.\\\" But then you find out he hasn\\\\'t, okay. He has a call. He has a check-up call from the hospital while I\\\\'m at my job. And he\\\\'s not answering. He says, \\\"Oh, have you done this?\\\" and then says, \\\"Ohh, I don\\\\'t even know. I should have done that.\\\" You prepare. You want to eat this food and then make it, and then bring it, but he doesn\\\\'t want to eat it anymore. He wants to eat something else. A lot of those things come up. Those are just a few examples, and it\\\\'s very stressful and very annoying. That\\\\'s the fifth one, right? Yeah. Yeah, factors such as professional commitment and financial constraints, yes. Our professional commitment, definitely. There was a time I should have gone. You know, my company was planning to sponsor me on a trip to the United Kingdom for a seminar and some other fellowship, as well as some other knowledge and professional stuffs. It was meant to be a two-week trip. But I found a way to get someone to stay with him, and it all fell apart. I wasn\\\\'t able to go. It was really painful at that moment.', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] At that moment, I had to back out of the opportunity I had been waiting for all my life. It was frustrating and terrible. Well, yes, it is what it is. I have gotten something close, but it doesn't pin me down as much. And when I think of it, I'm supposed to do overtime sometimes just to get some extra cash, but I just can't. I have to dash out of the office on time because I have someone I'm caregiving for. I'm a caregiver, you know. It's really frustrating. And then you get home and meet other stresses and things. It's frustrating. So, professional commitments are a barrier for me, as far as I'm concerned, then financial constraints or health challenges. Well, financial constraints aren't really a problem for me at this moment. I'm above moderate and have a very good salary. My father, you know, he's worked things out for himself. So he has health insurance and other things covered by the job. So I don't really have to worry about financial stuff. It's all available. I wouldn't say financial constraints are a problem. Then there are health changes. Well, I sometimes fall sick and the sick person is still caring for a sick person. So I try my best not to fall sick.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] But when I do well, my wife actually takes the responsibility for doing what I\\\\'ve been doing. So I think that\\\\'s basically it. I get distracted. I get a lot of distraction, a lot, lots of distraction. You know, sometimes he just makes some emergency calls and then you pick up. \\\"What\\\\'s up?\\\" he says, and that would be really annoying. Like you call me five times and just want to hear my voice for what? And then I\\\\'m just, you know, I see your call. I\\\\'m panicking now. Maybe something is wrong and I just have to pick it up. You know, sometimes you see your call. Your brain says, \\\"I\\\\'m busy,\\\" or you just shoot them a text. \\\"I\\\\'m busy. I\\\\'ll call you later.\\\" And then that\\\\'s all.\\\\n\\\\nAnd when you\\\\'re done with your job, you call them. But you see the call. You know, it\\\\'s given for. So you just have to pick it up and then you say, \\\"Ohh, I just want to hear your voice.\\\" Why just want to do this and then you be like, \\\"Don\\\\'t call me.\\\" I have to pick up because of this and that. Don\\\\'t just call, because when I hear my voice, I\\\\'m busy at my job and with other things, and then he doesn\\\\'t hear and he keeps calling. So I get distracted a lot.\\\\n\\\\nBut it\\\\'s part of the job of caregiving, definitely. Well, yes, definitely. There are some positions we want to be promoted to, but it\\\\'s going to hit hard into the time of my caregiving. So I\\\\'ve declined a few of those offers.', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] And then I hope it gets much, much better soon, so I can have fewer hours of care given, and perhaps take some professional promotions. No, I sleep well. I sleep well. He sleeps very well and wakes up early, so I have few issues. At night, I sleep well. For me, or for him? No, no, no, no, none of those.\\\\n\\\\nOkay. And do you sometimes feel concerned about what the future holds for you in this role? Yes, definitely. I definitely think about that. I've brought up that issue in family meetings and other discussions. So, no one is willing to take responsibility. Everyone's busy. Everyone is doing this and that, and it just feels like I have to keep doing this forever. I've declined many professional opportunities. I should have gotten promoted, which is costing me more money and other things. Then, this cake remains a barrier and other obstacles. Thinking about other things, I definitely have thoughts about what the future holds for me in this role. If it continues like this for a long time, I would have declined numerous offers and might still be in the same position for years. I'm hoping very soon that I'll have enough finances.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] We can actually transfer him to a stable, professional home where we have professional caregivers and such. But our greatest hope is that his conditions improve, which would mean fewer hours of caregiving for us. And then, on the days we continue to be caregivers, we'll have fewer hours because he cannot do many things by himself. Doctors assure us that such a possibility is near in the future. We're also hoping that, if that doesn't work out, I won't be considering professional caregiving homes anymore. So that's it about that.\\\\n\\\\nThe truth is, if we could find someone to cover shifts when I'm active for two days a week and he's active for another two days, matching our schedules for another two days, or if I ask for 12 hours a day and he takes the other 12 hours, it would greatly ease my stress and burdens. And then, if we have enough finances, we could move him to a professional place \\u2013 the kind where they don't view it as a task but as their job, having been trained for it. They don't have anything else to stop them from doing their job. I believe those are the two best options.\\\\n\\\\nDefinitely, I think about that solution around 100% of the time.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] First of all, it\\\\'s financial basis, and then we\\\\'ve had a lot of stories about professional caregivers. You know, there have been instances of neglect and terrible happenings. That\\\\'s something he doesn\\\\'t want. He kicks against it. He doesn\\\\'t want it. We\\\\'ve brought up the idea in some meetings where the family is willing to donate and have that done. But he himself doesn\\\\'t want that. He says if we try that and he gets escaped from there, he\\\\'ll run off and do some of those things. You know, it\\\\'s really hard. He doesn\\\\'t want it. And we\\\\'re also concerned about the risk. That\\\\'s why we haven\\\\'t implemented it. He forgets a lot very frequently. Oh, no, he doesn\\\\'t forget me. He knows me, he knows me. But he mostly forgets other family members, not me, not me. And he doesn\\\\'t remember them. Yes, definitely. Like, \\\"What are you?\\\" \\\"What are you looking for?\\\" You know, sometimes it\\\\'s like, \\\"Oh, oh, John, I have a stranger in this house.\\\" It\\\\'s trying to come to the front door, doing this and that. You\\\\'ve had calls like that when my wife was back at her job, and he called me up. \\\"Oh John, I have this woman, a lady at my door. I don\\\\'t know what she\\\\'s looking for. Can you call the cops? Can you do this?\\\" And I\\\\'m like, \\\"It\\\\'s my wife for God\\\\'s sake.\\\" So you have issues like that, but he\\\\'s not aggressive towards them. He just wants to know who is who and what is what. And I\\\\'m sure he\\\\'s safe. I would say he\\\\'s progressing towards neutral.', '\\\\n  [/INST] \\\"Yeah. I don\\\\'t read it; I\\\\'ll read it. Well, I feel I might share my experiences, and I was thinking of possibly sharing some resources that can help me on my caregiving journey. Maybe we can discuss such things during the meeting.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n--End of Response--']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

major caregiver ok answering question one well for past few weeks yeah its about years to years hes why so weak so before going to my job i ensure hes fine i provide every basic things he needs you know he slowed his his emails his phone calls voicemails he has sure everything are kept in check sure hes using his medication they are all set before i go to my job at my job i always calling i calling at least twice to check on him to make sure hes doing fine make sure hes not having any reaction side effects to medication make sure hes resting one is supposed to make sure hes doing little exercise that has been prepared for him you know when im back also i take him we go for walk take stroll around we do little exercise sometimes we go to church together there sure he also eats well eat fruits eats necessary things those use medication those little exercise then also on days of his visit to hospital so its just like normal thing you do for your child i immediately im responsible for most of things ok someone says that ok well for past few weeks i would say pressure is much more lesser than before then i had you know when we first started it was lot for me to taking balancing being caregiver also having full time job its really really tough its really tough then being at entry level someone with little i have buses which im also under their command you know its really hard to have my wish in time like that so then also its its always very difficult coping with new development you know things your father can do before easily before you find it you say that hes having hard time doing them you always just have to be around ensuring that it does it right so its always very tough to take in its really hard to believe that this is happening so for for past few weeks ice after that im finding it little bit more easier because ive let it become part of me ive let it become something i do you know i would im willing to go extra mile to make sure theyre ok theyre fine because theyve also sacrificed lot for me so for past few weeks i have made it my habits you know something i do without being for something i do without seeing it thats hard job though theres lot of challenge definitely lot of challenge tell him something he forgets it easily has few reactions some things you did yesterday you can remember some things you know lot of things lot of challenges but ive learned to just calm down you know sometimes when its overwhelming i just take walk just listen to music just do something to calm me myself down because i cannot be transferring aggression to him i cannot show any sign of no anger any other things because it would really really affect his own wellbeing so i rather would rather take walk on his throat rather just turn my earbuds on listen to loud music just do something to just chill off before i can actually think on what next to do so i would say im really coping nicely im finding strategies to make it much more easier for me so thats how that is ok well relationship with friends family colleagues definitely there is shift i spend more time at home apart from my job apart from my job you know most times then i would love to socialize you know visit friends go to watch game go to at club go to lottery houses you know i spent my most of my free times there my weekends you know im socializing im hanging out im doing lot of stuff sports now i have to spend there with my parents my dad because he needs care everything is getting better though but he needs care so thats affected my relationship with my friends well it makes me my wife have much more time together since im spending more time at home with my father shes always around too so but with my friends thats really severed relationship we do lot of call video calls you know voice calls to kind of compensate for may not being able to show up there sometimes that some occasions will clash with days he has to go to hospital so its really done little to that my friends my colleagues you know my colleague maybe having birthday celebration at his home hes having occasion its classes with sometime by time i have to just be with my dad so most of them do actually understand they understand my situation they dont get annoyed so we go to watch some basketball sometimes makes him more happy makes him lively you know you see him celebrate him when he sees says he hook he goes cold some other things makes him more lively you know it adds makes health better some other things so thats pretty much how when i go out then relationship with my friends colleagues it has done little damage to it definitely i it has it is about where its stopping me from going out its making me spend more time at home spend more time with my dad just ensuring that things are going as it should but i dont see that as you know when you people say barrier you know its something very negative something terrible something you dont want to but it is what it is now im not seeing it as barrier im just saying that is that how can i describe it as alternative you know im learning new way of life instead of being that you know extroverts talk so much going out partying having so much fun spending money wasting money wasting time doing some other things i now taking all those energies transfer it into something useful apart from while im even caregiving i have some remote things i do i trade crypto i do some other things so i want to say its barrier anymore it has taught me how to actually invest in myself do things while im at home so that also helped me in way ok well in my decision making process i think no real change no real change no real change any decision i need to make you know in regards to him sometimes he actually is able to make few decisions sometimes you know explaining some things to him he doesnt understand we write it down let him greet we play it let him listen to it very slowly then if he understands he can make some decisions he makes about of decisions i make about so in regards to him i dont think there is any change in my decision making process then its more than fine i think twice before i make any decisions i compare my alternatives i consider lot of choices before i can actually make decision but as regards myself well some decisions i make as regards my own life i shared this with my wife theres no real need of sharing with my dad because even if i shared with him before tomorrow he forgets something like that so my decisions as regards myself my family i dont really share them with him because he dont really are remembers most of those things few ones that actually you know but you know real issues as regarding my decision making process i dont share that with him there is no change you know when you say change in decision making process maybe because im frustrated i make certain decisions because im angry i make certain decisions ive taught myself so much to be able to control all those calm myself down take it through listen to good music do something that just you know its little stressful now then when im come when im settled i can now think my way out of making very good decision because when you make decisions when you are annoyed most times it is end of time there are no good decisions because at that point i wont say youve lost your mind but you are totally out of yourself such situation might be really really terrible have nasty consequences so ive taught myself how to control them yeah that that is definitely true thats definitely true caregiving it sure it doesnt clash with you stuffs especially critical visits to hospitals so i make sure any vacation something doesnt tamper with that well about location i have home here so i dont see any circumstance of me you know moving out of this area for at least for next years so but if there would be maybe case maybe any circumstance that would actually need relocation movement i think there even would definitely be barrier because we have to actually transfer hospitals then get stable around place where we are feed them with all previous information they need to know then continue doing it there because it definitely is factor i would consider before i make such kinds of huge decisions you know decisions that would really affect him like me going on vacation locating going for holidays somewhere something it is major function that i have to consider ok now commitment page yeah definitely professional commitment yes eversource yeah self keep practicing yeah manage daily stress describe yourself here properties past weeks might stress of caregiving share strategies ok well selfcare practices like i said sometimes it gets very frustrating you know sometimes some things you tell him you forget its really annoying because sometimes its annoying definitely any normal person will get annoyed with some things like i said in previous recordings i have taught myself to manage these stresses it wasnt days job two years job three years job its been over years now so i go for walk when im having when im feeling stress you know having gone to my full time job makes lot of difficulties stuffs problems every other thing im coming back then i just want peace then im still having lot of things to deal with you know frustration sets in terrible mood swings anger every other thing so i learned to take walk you know once its not that its in critical situation where i need to be there i will just take walk i just go to my music room put on my earbuds listen to music play piano do something that would ease my stress i just even go to sitting room just watch netflix just laugh laugh out sometimes then is stress away so some of strategies have actually been employing sure i go away from that then sometimes i just you know i just try to cope with it i makes decisions not to get annoyed you know some things are supposed to make you annoyed then to see why am i why am i why am i even getting annoyed for no reason listen isnt something much that should get me annoyed then i just flush out thought of being annoyed then take it as something normal so i think those are some of major strategies i have employed as regards coping with daily stresses every other stuff how frequently ill say ill say majorly five days week five days i got my job definitely very stressful i dont even know that i should have done that then you prepare you want to eat this food then you make it then you bring it he doesnt want to eat it anymore he wants to eat something else you know lot of those things come up those are just few of examples its very stressful very annoying thats fifth one yeah factors such as professional commitment financial constraints yes our professional commitment definitely you know there was time i should you know have i my company was planning to actually sponsor me on trip to i think to united kingdom you know for seminar some other fellowship then for some other knowledge professional stuffs it was meant to be two weeks then i found way to get someone to stay with him every other thing it just fell apart i wasnt able to go it was really painful at that moment at that moment i you know just had to back out of opportunity that i had been waiting all my life for then it was frustrating terrible yeah it is what it is i have gotten something close that now so it doesnt pin me so much when i think of it so lot of professional commitments you know sometimes i am supposed to do over some over time just to get some extra cash then i just cant i just have to be dashing out of office money time because i have someone im caregiving you know its really really frustrating then you get home you meet some other stress some other things frustrating so i would say professional commitment care given standards barrier between lot of professional commitments as far as im concerned then financial constraints health challenges well financial constraints for me at this moment im im above moderate in very good salary my father also you know hes worked some things down for himself so he has his health insurance some other things that basically covered by job things he has done while he was still active so i dont really have support care about financial stuff it is well available so i wont say financial constraints is really any problem then health changes well sometimes i also fall sick then sick person still caring for sick person so i try my as best as much as i as i can not to fall sick i get distracted get lot of distraction lot lots of distraction you know sometimes he just makes some emergency call then you pick up you be like whats up says i just want to hear your voice you know that would be really annoying like you call me five times just want to hear my voice for what then im just you know i see your call im panicking now maybe something is wrong i just have to pick it up you know sometimes you see your call you know my brain say oh im busy you just shoot them text im busy ill call you later then thats all when you are done with job you call them but you see call you know it you know is someone ok given for so you just have to pick it up then you say ohh im busy at my job some other things then he doesnt hear he keeps calling so i get distracted lot yes definitely there are some positions i want us to be promoted to but its going to definitely hit hit into time of my care given so ive declined few of those offers then i hope it gets very very much more better soon then i can have less hours care given then maybe take some professional you know promotions no i sleep well i sleep well eat good he sleeps very he sleeps very early he wakes up late no no none of those ok do you sometimes feel concerned about what future holds for you in room definitely i definitely think about that i definitely think about that ive table that you know in family meetings some other stuff so you know no one is willing to take responsibility everyones busy everyone is doing this that it just feels like i just have to keep doing this forever then i think that well ive actually declined lot of professional things i should have you know gotten promoted getting costing me more money getting me you know some other things then this cake even is staying as barrier some other things you know just thinking about some other things so i definitely have thoughts most of time what future holds for me in this role because if it continues like this for long time you know i would have to decline lot of offers along line i might still be in same position for years so i consider that then im hoping very soon that one actually have enough finances we can actually transfer him to stable you know professional home where we have professional caregivers stuff like that but utmost prayer is that his conditions improve then we actually have less hours of caregiving then we are still caregivers that day but we have less hours because he cannot do many things by himself well doctors are promised that that is possibility in nearest future we are also hoping that god if that is possible but if that doesnt work out then at some point i wont be considering i would be considering professional caregiving homes so i guess thats it about that well truth is if i have someone someone else if we can run something like shift when im active for these two days week then hes active for another two days match for another two days im asking for hours day then he takes other hours you know something like that it would ease me of lot of stress lot of burdens then if possibly if we have enough finances we can just move him to professional place you know those ones they dont see it as task theyve been trained for that then they do it to any living so thats their job they dont have something else to stop in them so i think those might be two great options definitely definitely i think about that by percent of time first of all its financial basis then also weve had lot of stories about professional caregivers you know neglect terrible happenings that weve had that doesnt want he weve actually brought up in some meetings where family is willing to donate then get that done but he himself doesnt want that he says if we try that he gets escaped from there hes gonna run off do some of that stuffs you know its really hard then we also we are concerned about risk so thats why were not really implemented he forgets lot very frequently no he doesnt forget me he doesnt forget me he knows me he knows me mostly forget some other family members but i have stranger in this house its trying to come to front door doing this that you know ive had calls like that when my wife you know my wife was back at her job then he called me up ohh john but hes not aggressive towards them he just wants to know who is who what is what im sure hes safe i would say progressive out to neutral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ADJ\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n

i dont used to allow her to go outside alone two times in week no no not him stressful\",\n          \"ok my name is yeah my name is john smith i am years old i am child to you know person with dementia is my father ok im only one who is major caregiver ok answering question one well for past few weeks yeah its about years to years hes why so weak yeah im im always with him he stays with me we stay together so before going to my job i ensure hes fine i provide every basic things he needs you know he slowed his his emails his phone calls voicemails he has sure everything are kept in check sure hes using his medication they are all set before i go to my job at my job i always calling i calling at least twice to check on him to make sure hes doing fine make sure hes not having any reaction side effects to medication make sure hes resting one is supposed to make sure hes doing little exercise that has been prepared for him you know when im back also i take him we go for walk take stroll around we do little exercise sometimes we go to church together there sure he also eats well eat fruits eats necessary things those use medication those little exercise then also on days of his visit to hospital sure i take him there on time im always saying while hes in doctor we are done you know come back home so its just like normal thing you do for your child so it i immediately im responsible for most of things ok someone says that ok well for past few weeks i would say pressure is much more lesser than before then i had you know when we first started it was lot for me to taking balancing being caregiver also having full time job its really really tough its really tough then being at entry level someone with little no you know superiority i have buses which im also under their command you know its really hard to have my wish in time like that so then also its its always very difficult coping with new development you know things your father can do before easily before you find it you say that hes having hard time doing them you always just have to be around ensuring that it does it right so its always very tough to take in its really hard to believe that this is happening so for for past few weeks ice after that im finding it little bit more easier because ive let it become part of me ive let it become something i do you know not because i want to receive award for some you know some people work because they just want to get pay some people do some things because they just want to you know receive profits from it but when you do something because of all of you have for person you dont count it as something that even if its not reciprocated well you dont see it as anything so ive learned to teach myself to do it because i love my father my parents i would im willing to go extra mile to make sure theyre ok theyre fine because theyve also sacrificed lot for me so for past few weeks i have made it my habits you know something i do without being for something i do without seeing it thats hard job though theres lot of challenge definitely lot of challenge tell him something he forgets it easily has few reactions some things you did yesterday you can remember some things you know lot of things lot of challenges but ive learned to just calm down you know sometimes when its overwhelming i just take walk just listen to music just do something to calm me myself down because i cannot be transferring aggression to him i cannot show any sign of no anger any other things because it would really really affect his own wellbeing so i rather would rather take walk on his throat rather just turn my earbuds on listen to loud music just do something to just chill off before i can actually think on what next to do so i would say im really coping nicely im finding strategies to make it much more easier for me so thats how that is ok well relationship with friends family colleagues definitely there is shift i spend more time at home apart from my job apart from my job you know most times then i would love to socialize you know visit friends go to watch game go to at club go to lottery houses you know i spent my most of my free times there my weekends you know im socializing im hanging out im doing lot of stuff sports now i have to spend there with my parents my dad because he needs care everything is getting better though but he needs care so thats affected my relationship with my friends well it makes me my wife have much more time together since im spending more time at home with my father shes always around too so but with my friends thats really severed relationship we do lot of call video calls you know voice calls to kind of compensate for may not being able to show up there sometimes that some occasions will clash with days he has to go to hospital i just have to cancel occasion you know so its really done little to that my friends my colleagues you know my colleague maybe having birthday celebration at his home hes having occasion its classes with sometime by time i have to just be with my dad so most of them do actually understand they understand my situation they dont get annoyed but definitely i would say it has really affected it has made me more introvert no staying indoors just loving things i can do indoors you know i only go out when i have to apart from my job sometimes i take my dad also sees to see game because he loves basketball so we go to watch some basketball sometimes makes him more happy makes him lively you know you see him celebrate him when he sees says he hook he goes cold some other things makes him more lively you know it adds makes health better some other things so thats pretty much how when i go out then relationship with my friends colleagues it has done little damage to it definitely definitely it is it is i it has it is about where its stopping me from going out its making me spend more time at home spend more time with my dad just ensuring that things are going as it should so but i dont see that as you know when you people say barrier you know its something very negative something terrible something you dont want to but it is what it is now im not seeing it as barrier im just saying that is that how can i describe it as alternative you know im learning new way of life instead of being that you know extroverts talk so much going out partying having so much fun spending money wasting money wasting time doing some other things i now taking all those energies transfer it into something useful apart from while im even caregiving i have some remote things i do i trade crypto i do some other things so i want to say its barrier anymore it has taught me how to actually invest in myself do things while im at home so that also helped me in way ok well in my decision making process i think no real change no real change no real change any decision i need to make you know in regards to him sometimes he actually is able to make few decisions sometimes you know explaining some things to him he doesnt understand we write it down let him greet we play it let him listen to it very slowly then if he understands he can make some decisions he makes about of decisions i make about so in regards to him i dont think there is any change in my decision making process then its more than fine i think twice before i make any decisions i compare my alternatives i consider lot of choices before i can actually make decision but as regards myself well some decisions i make as regards my own life i shared this with my wife theres no real need of sharing with my dad because even if i shared with him before tomorrow he forgets something like that so my decisions as regards myself my family i dont really share them with him because he dont really are remembers most of those things few ones that actually you know like maybe ah ohh its your granddaughter birthday its your grandsons birthday something like that ohh its your its your wifes birthday its my birthday you know things like that that theyre just for moment so we share those with him but you know real issues as regarding my decision making process i dont share that with him there is no change you know when you say change in decision making process maybe because im frustrated i make certain decisions because im angry i make certain decisions ive taught myself so much to be able to control all those calm myself down take it through listen to good music do something that just you know its little stressful now then when im come when im settled i can now think my way out of making very good decision because when you make decisions when you are annoyed most times it is end of time there are no good decisions because at that point i wont say youve lost your mind but you are totally out of yourself such situation might be really really terrible have nasty consequences so ive taught myself how to control them yeah that that is definitely true thats definitely true caregiving yes definitely it does affect it affects those decisions you know i before i go for any vacation of stuff i have to plan it very well it sure it doesnt clash with you stuffs especially critical visits to hospitals so i make sure any vacation something doesnt tamper with that well about location i have home here so i dont see any circumstance of me you know moving out of this area for at least for next years so i love this place i settled in i think im doing fine so but if there would be maybe case maybe any circumstance that would actually need relocation movement i think there even would definitely be barrier because we have to actually transfer hospitals then get stable around place where we are feed them with all previous information they need to know then continue doing it there because it definitely is factor i would consider before i make such kinds of huge decisions you know decisions that would really affect him like me going on vacation locating going for holidays somewhere something it is major function that i have to consider ok now commitment page yeah definitely professional commitment yes eversource definitely they have affected some things with us ok yeah self keep practicing yeah manage daily stress describe yourself here properties past weeks might stress of caregiving share strategies ok well selfcare practices like i said sometimes it gets very frustrating you know sometimes some things you tell him you forget its really annoying because sometimes its annoying definitely any normal person will get annoyed with some things like i said in previous recordings i have taught myself to manage these stresses it wasnt days job two years job three years job its been over years now so i go for walk when im having when im feeling stress you know having gone to my full time job makes lot of difficulties stuffs problems every other thing im coming back then i just want peace then im still having lot of things to deal with you know frustration sets in terrible mood swings anger every other thing so i learned to take walk you know once its not that its in critical situation where i need to be there i will just take walk i just go to my music room put on my earbuds listen to music play piano do something that would ease my stress i just even go to sitting room just watch netflix just laugh laugh out sometimes then is stress away so some of strategies have actually been employing sure i go away from that you know i i go away from where he is just try to ease with stress then then sometimes then sometimes i just you know i just try to cope with it i makes decisions not to get annoyed you know some things are supposed to make you annoyed then to see why am i why am i why am i even getting annoyed for no reason listen isnt something much that should get me annoyed then i just flush out thought of being annoyed then take it as something normal so i think those are some of major strategies i have employed as regards coping with daily stresses every other stuff how frequently ill say ill say majorly five days week five days i got my job definitely very stressful well i would say is about him keeping to his routine he knows what he should be doing at this time he knows what he should be doing at that time then you ask him have you done this ohh ive done it then you find out hes not done it ok he has call he has check up call from hospital while im at my job hes not hes not picking them up hes not answering he say oh have you done this say ohh i dont even know that i should have done that then you prepare you want to eat this food then you make it then you bring it he doesnt want to eat it anymore he wants to eat something else you know lot of those things come up those are just few of examples its very stressful very annoying thats fifth one right yeah yeah factors such as professional commitment financial constraints yes our professional commitment definitely you know there was time i should you know have i my company was planning to actually sponsor me on trip to i think to united kingdom you know for seminar some other fellowship then for some other knowledge professional stuffs it was meant to be two weeks then i found way to get someone to stay with him every other thing it just fell apart i wasnt able to go it was really painful at that moment at that moment i you know just had to back out of opportunity that i had been waiting all my life for then it was frustrating terrible well yeah it is what it is i have gotten something close that now so it doesnt pin me so much when i think of it so lot of professional commitments you know sometimes i am supposed to do over some over time just to get some extra cash then i just cant i just have to be dashing out of office money time because i have someone im caregiving you know its really really frustrating then you get home you meet some other stress some other things frustrating so i would say professional commitment care given standards barrier between lot of professional commitments as far as im concerned then financial constraints health challenges well financial constraints for me at this moment well i thank god i think im im im above moderate in very good salary my father also you know hes worked some things down for himself so he has his health insurance some other things that basically covered by job things he has done while he was still active so i dont really have support care about financial stuff it is well available so i wont say financial constraints is really any problem then health changes well sometimes i also fall sick then sick person still caring for sick person so i try my as best as much as i as i can not to fall sick but when i do i well my wife actually takes takes responsibility of doing what ive been doing so i think thats basically it i get distracted get lot of distraction lot lots of distraction you know sometimes he just makes some emergency call then you pick up you be like whats up says i just want to hear your voice you know that would be really annoying like you call me five times just want to hear my voice for what then im just you know i see your call im panicking now maybe something is wrong i just have to pick it up you know sometimes you see your call you know my brain say oh im busy you just shoot them text im busy ill call you later then thats all when you are done with job you call them but you see call you know it you know is someone ok given for so you just have to pick it up then you say ohh i just want to hear your voice why just want to do this then you be like dont call me like this when i see your call i have to pick up because of this that dont just call because when i hear my voice im busy at my job some other things then he doesnt hear he keeps calling so i get distracted lot so but its part of job of caregiving definitely well yes definitely there are some positions i want us to be promoted to but its going to definitely hit hit into time of my care given so ive declined few of those offers then i hope it gets very very much more better soon then i can have less hours care given then maybe take some professional you know promotions no i sleep well i sleep well eat good he sleeps very he sleeps very early he wakes up late so i hardly have any issues at night i sleep well for me for him no no no no none of those ok do you sometimes feel concerned about what future holds for you in room yeah definitely i definitely think about that i definitely think about that ive table that you know in family meetings some other stuff so you know no one is willing to take responsibility everyones busy everyone is doing this that it just feels like i just have to keep doing this forever then i think that well ive actually declined lot of professional things i should have you know gotten promoted getting costing me more money getting me you know some other things then this cake even is staying as barrier some other things you know just thinking about some other things so i definitely have thoughts most of time what future holds for me in this role because if it continues like this for long time you know i would have to decline lot of offers along line i might still be in same position for years so i consider that then im hoping very soon that one actually have enough finances we can actually transfer him to stable you know professional home where we have professional caregivers stuff like that but utmost prayer is that his conditions improve then we actually have less hours of caregiving then we are still caregivers that day but we have less hours because he cannot do many things by himself well doctors are promised that that is possibility in nearest future we are also hoping that god if that is possible but if that doesnt work out then at some point i wont be considering i would be considering professional caregiving homes so i guess thats it about that well truth is if i have someone someone else if we can run something like shift when im active for these two days week then hes active for another two days match for another two days im asking for hours day then he takes other hours you know something like that it would ease me of lot of stress lot of burdens then if possibly if we have enough finances we can just move him to professional place you know those ones they dont see it as task theyve been trained for that then they do it to any living so thats their job they dont have something else to stop in them so i think those might be two great options ok yeah definitely definitely i think about that by percent of time first of all its financial basis then also weve had lot of stories about professional caregivers you know neglect terrible happenings that weve had that doesnt want he he he kicks he kicks against it he doesnt want it weve actually brought up in some meetings where family is willing to donate then get that done but he himself doesnt want that he says if we try that he gets escaped from there hes gonna run off do some of that stuffs you know its really hard he doesnt want it then we also we are concerned about risk so thats why were not really implemented he forgets lot very frequently ohh me no he doesnt forget me he doesnt forget me he knows me he knows me mostly forget some other family members but not not me not me doesnt remember them yeah definitely like oh what are you what are you looking for you know sometimes like oh oh john i have stranger in this house its trying to come to front door doing this that you know ive had calls like that when my wife you know my wife was back at her job then he called me up ohh john i have this woman lady at my door i dont know what shes looking for can you call cops can you do this im like its my wife for gods sake so you have issues like that so but hes not aggressive towards them he just wants to know who is who what is what im sure hes safe i would say progressive out to neutral yeah so i dont read it read it well i feel i might share my experiences then i was thinking maybe there are some resources that can actually help me caregiving journey maybe something like that would also be shared during meeting so those are things im looking for\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

Bonnie. I'm 28 years old. Single. I live with my parents. I stay with my parents, as I do who I am. I give care to them, very well. I am the only caregiver for my mother, who is 56 years old. It's been five years since I've been caring for her.\\\\n\\\\nShare how you have been feeling in the past few weeks while taking care of your loved one with dementia. Tell us about any moment, whether positive or challenging, that stands out to you. It's been a difficult life for me, reducing my participation in studies and other aspects of my life. So the past few weeks have been a challenging time for me.\\\\n\\\\nGoing to parties and school are things I've had to stop. I've stopped going to school to take care of my mother. No positive moments stand out.\\\\n\\\\nIn financial aspects, I don't have any money to continue taking care of her. Cooking for her can be difficult, as she often screams, shouts, and yells. I leave her care to my meter when I can.\\\\n\\\\nRegarding your relationships with family, friends, or anyone online, have there been any changes or shifts? I haven't noticed any changes. My life has been this way for the past five years.\\\\n\\\\nMy family and friends have distanced themselves because I'm taking care of my mother. I'm the only one with her now. No, it doesn't affect me.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] My communication and attention have been divided among my family and friends, as well as my colleagues at school. I've only managed to invite one friend to join me for the past four to five years. Even when I call her, it takes her two to three days to respond. I'm having trouble hearing you. Could you please repeat? I can't hear you. Yes, I believe that's question 3.\\\\n\\\\nMy family and I discussed the other time that my family and friends are no longer with me. They have left me alone. Only one friend remains with whom I can call. She used to take three to four days to come when I called.\\\\n\\\\nOver the past few weeks, you and the kids have not been involved in the engineering process intentionally. I've made some changes in my decision-making process. This is due to the food I eat at home and the financial situation, as well as my mother's sickness. I often think about her and prioritize her needs first.\\\\n\\\\nRegarding question 4, I'd be happy to describe my self-care practices over the past few weeks to manage the daily stresses of caregiving. My strategies for coping with the steady stress of caregiving include:\\\\n\\\\n1. The time I spend cooking for her and taking care of her. This time is dedicated to her care, management, and making her happy.\\\\n2. I engage in social media and surf the internet as a means of rest.\\\\n\\\\n(Note: The original text did not contain a clear question or prompt for response, so I assumed the response should address the general topic of self-care practices and coping strategies for caregiving.)\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] Whenever I take care of us, and I, whenever she is asleep, I used to sleep too. I used to take a rest. My responsibility is to make sure I wake up before she does. I used to sleep very well before and go out, go to schools, go to clubs. I used to party very well, but now I don't do that anymore. I used to drive and just put the car on and go wherever, whenever, wherever I was going. (Pause) I can't hear you. No, nobody is there. It's to go out. I didn't used to leave her at home and go out. I go out with her now. I'll put her inside the car and go out. Nobody is there to stay with her.\\\\n\\\\nIn the past few weeks, earning factors such as professional commitment, financial constraints, and health challenges have influenced how I manage my fees. Based on this, these special therapists used to allow her to come, but now there is no financial support from anyone. So, I had to go and carry out my caregiving duties at the government hospital. (Pause) Yes, there have been no changes because I don't have any money. I'm not financially buoyant now. (Pause) I can't hear you.\\\\n\\\\nYes, my health isn't my home or my mother's health. My health is a concern for me. At least I'm coping a little. I get tired. Stress is too much for me. I get tired every now and then. I'm a caregiver to my mother because I take care of her. I've not seen any support from anyone. I work remotely.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] And I work for her for three hours, and the remaining hours are for taking care of her. No, she's not the one answering me. I'm doing it because of my mother. I'll just make sure that I have given her her drugs, her food, and then I'll start working. It has reduced my wages.\\\\n\\\\nLike, two weeks ago, when I was working, she was awake. I had to stop what I was doing then and attend to her. This has affected me in a lot of ways. What do I do? Ah, I used to give her more than ten hours of care. As a caregiver, do you sometimes feel concerned about what the future holds for you in that role? If so, could you share more about it? What kind of help or support will you need?\\\\n\\\\nThe Economist asks, as a caregiver, do you sometimes feel concerned about the future? What does the future hold for you in that role? If so, yes, because I need a partner. I will still have my husband and get married one day. So I need an assistant. I need a partner too. Yes. No, no, no, no. No.\\\\n\\\\nPlease repeat the question. I can't hear you. Yes. Yes, I'm here. I'm here. I need to dedicate my time to her. I require both her attention and financial support. I can't remember, not really. I can't remember anything now. Like the moment I went to look for some jobs to do, and she needed my attention. So I had to attend to her before going. She can remember me. I show her some old videos of ours, some pictures, and lots more.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] She reacts amazingly. She goes into her room when someone comes in. As she reacts amazingly, sometimes, not every time. No, she doesn't react that way. No, she remembers me. No, she didn't used to allow him to go outside alone, but she did it two times a week. No, it's not him. Stressful.\\\"]\",\n          \"[\\\"\\\\n  [/INST] My name is John Smith. I'm 26 years old. I'm the only child of a person with dementia. Is my father? I'm the major caregiver. I've been doing well with answering question one for the past few weeks, for about 7 to 8 years. He's 57. Why is he this way? It's weak. I'm always with him. He stays with me. We stay together. Before going to my job, I ensure he's fine. I provide every basic thing he needs. He's slowed down with his emails, phone calls, voicemails, and I make sure they're all kept in check. I ensure he's using his medication, which are all set before I go to my job. I call at least twice a day to check on him, to make sure he's doing fine, to ensure he's not having any reactions or side effects to the medication, and to make sure he's resting. One should make sure he's doing the little exercise that's been prepared for him. When I'm back, we go for walks, take a stroll around. We do little exercises together. Sometimes we go to church together. He also eats well, eats fruits, and consumes the necessary things. Those on medication, those little exercises, and the hospital visits are also taken care of. I take him to the hospital on time. It's just like taking care of a normal child. I'm immediately responsible for most of the things.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] \\\"OK, someone says that. Well, for the past few weeks, I would say the pressure is much less than before. I had to acknowledge, when we first started, it was a lot for me to balance being a caregiver and having a full-time job. It\\\\'s really tough. It\\\\'s really tough. And then, being at an entry level, with little or no superiority, I have buses to contend with, which I\\\\'m also under their command. It\\\\'s really hard for me to have my wishes met in a timely manner. So, it\\\\'s always very difficult to cope with new developments. You know, things your father could do before easily, you find him having a hard time doing them, and you always have to be around and ensure that they\\\\'re done right. It\\\\'s always very tough to take in. It\\\\'s really hard to believe that this is happening. So, for the past few weeks, I\\\\'ve found it a little bit easier because I\\\\'ve let it become a part of me. I\\\\'ve let it become something I do, not because I want to receive an award or profits from it, but because I love my father and parents, and I would.\\\"', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] I'm willing to go the extra mile to make sure they're okay. They're fine because they've also sacrificed a lot for me. And so, for the past few weeks, I have made it a habit to do something without seeing it as a chore. That's a hard job, though. There's a lot of challenge, definitely. He forgets things easily and has few reactions. Some things you did yesterday, you can remember some of them. You know, a lot of things, a lot of challenges, but I've learned to just calm down. You know, sometimes when it's overwhelming, I just take a walk. Or just listen to music or just do something to calm myself down because I cannot transfer aggression to him. I cannot show any sign of anger and other things because it would really, really affect his own well-being. So, I rather take a walk or turn on my earbuds and listen to loud music. Or just do something to chill off before I can actually think about what next to do.\\\\n\\\\nSo, I would say I'm really coping nicely and finding strategies to make it much easier for me. So that's how it is.\\\\n\\\\nOK. Well, the relationship with friends, family, and colleagues has definitely shifted. I spend more time at home, apart from my job. Most times, I would love to socialize, you know, visit friends, go to watch a game, go to the club, go to lottery houses, you know.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] I spent most of my free time there. My weekends, you know, I'm socializing. I'm hanging out. I'm doing a lot of stuff. Sports. Now I have to spend time there with my parents, my dad. Because he needs care and everything is getting better, though he needs care. That's affected my relationship with my friends. And well, it makes me and my wife have much more time together since I'm spending more time at home with my father, and she's always around too. So, but with my friends, that's really severed the relationship. We do a lot of call video calls, you know, voice calls to kind of compensate for not being able to show up there. Sometimes, some occasions will clash with the days he has to go to the hospital, and I just have to cancel. The occasion, you know, so it's really done a little to that, my friends, my colleagues, you know, my colleague, maybe. Having a birthday celebration at his home or he's having an occasion, and it clashes with some classes. By the time I have to just be with my dad. So. Most of them do actually understand. They understand my situation, and they don't get annoyed, but definitely, I would say it has really affected me. It has made me more introverted. No staying outdoors. And, just loving things I can do indoors, you know, and I only go out when I have to, apart from my job. Sometimes, I take my dad to see a game because he loves basketball. So, we go to watch some basketball. Sometimes, it makes him happier, makes him livelier.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] You know, you see him celebrating when he sees. Says he, \\\"I hook him.\\\" He goes cold and some other things make him more lively. You know, it adds to making his health better and some other things. So that\\\\'s pretty much how it goes when I go out, and then the relationship with my friends and colleagues has done a little damage to it, definitely. Definitely, it is. It is I who it has stopped. It\\\\'s about where it\\\\'s stopping me from going out and making me spend more time at home, more time with my dad, just ensuring that things are going as they should. But I don\\\\'t see that.\\\\n\\\\nAs you know, when people say barrier, you know it\\\\'s something very negative, something terrible, something you don\\\\'t want. But it is what it is. And now I\\\\'m not seeing it as a barrier. I\\\\'m just saying that\\\\'s how I can describe it as an alternative. You know, I\\\\'m learning a new way of life instead of being the extrovert who talks so much about going out, partying, having so much fun, spending money, wasting money, and wasting time doing other things. Now, I\\\\'m taking all those energies and transferring them into something useful, apart from caregiving. I have some remote things I do, like trading crypto, and I do other things. So I want to say it\\\\'s no longer a barrier. It has taught me how to actually invest in myself and do things while I\\\\'m at home, which also helped me in a way.\\\\n\\\\nOK. Well, in my decision-making process, there\\\\'s no real change, no real change, no real change.', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] Any decision I need to make, in regards to him: Sometimes he's able to make a few decisions, explaining things to him, he doesn't always understand. We write it down or play it slowly and let him greet or listen. If he understands, he can make some decisions. He makes about 50% of decisions, and I make about 50%. Regarding him, there's no change in my decision-making process. I think twice before making any decisions, comparing alternatives, and considering many choices. However, regarding myself and my family, I don't share those decisions with him because he often forgets. For instance, it's your granddaughter's birthday, or it's your grandson's birthday, or it's your wife's birthday, or it's my birthday. We share those with him for the moment. But regarding real issues concerning my decision-making process, I don't share that with him, and there's no change.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] You know, when you say \\\"change in decision-making process,\\\" maybe because I\\\\'m frustrated, I make certain decisions. Or, because I\\\\'m angry, I make certain decisions. I\\\\'ve taught myself to control those, to calm myself down, to think it through, to listen to good music, or do something that helps me relax. When I\\\\'m settled, I can then make a good decision. Decisions made when you\\\\'re annoyed most times are not good, as at that point, you\\\\'re not fully in control of yourself. Such situations can be really terrible and have nasty consequences. I\\\\'ve taught myself how to control them. That\\\\'s definitely true. That\\\\'s definitely true.\\\\n\\\\nCaregiving affects decisions, too. Before I go on any vacation or do anything, I plan it well to ensure it doesn\\\\'t clash with critical hospital visits. I make sure any vacation or something doesn\\\\'t interfere with that.\\\\n\\\\nAs for location, I have a home here, so I don\\\\'t see any circumstances of me moving out of this area for at least the next 10 to 20 years. I\\\\'ve settled in, and I think I\\\\'m doing fine. But,\\\\n\\\\n--End of Response--', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] If there were perhaps a case or any circumstance that would require relocation or movement, I think there would definitely be a barrier. We would have to transfer hospitals and then establish a stable base at the new location. Feed them with all the necessary information and continue doing so there, as this is a significant factor I would consider before making such decisions, which could significantly impact him, such as my going on vacation or relocating somewhere. This is a major function I have to consider.\\\\n\\\\nNow, let's move on to the commitment page. Yes, definitely. Professional commitment, yes. Eversource has indeed affected some things for us.\\\\n\\\\nApril 20, yes. Keep practicing self. Manage daily stress. Describe yourself here, properties, and past weeks. Might the stress of caregiving share strategies?\\\\n\\\\nOK, well, self-care practices. I sometimes find caregiving very frustrating. You know, there are things I tell him that I forget. It can be quite annoying, as even a normal person would get annoyed with some things. I've taught myself to manage these stresses. It wasn't a one-day or two-year job; it's been over seven years now. So, I go for a walk when I'm feeling stressed.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] When I'm feeling stressed, you know, coming home from my full-time job creates a lot of difficulties and problems, and every other thing. And I just want peace. But I'm still dealing with a lot of things, you know, frustration sets in. Terrible mood swings, anger, and every other thing. So I learned to take a walk, you know, not when it's a critical situation where I need to be there. I will just take a walk or go to my music room, put on my earbuds, listen to music or play the piano, or do something that eases my stress. And I just go to the sitting room and watch Netflix. I just laugh, sometimes out loud, and then the stress is away. Some of the strategies I have employed to cope with daily stresses and every other thing are:\\\\n\\\\n1. Taking a walk\\\\n2. Going to the music room\\\\n3. Watching Netflix\\\\n4. Employing strategies to cope with stress\\\\n\\\\nI employ these strategies frequently, about five days a week.\\\\n\\\\nI try to make decisions not to get annoyed. You know, some things are supposed to make you annoyed, and then I just flush out the thought of being annoyed and take it as something normal. So, these are some of the major strategies I have employed as regards coping with daily stresses.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] The five days I received the job offer. Definitely very stressful. Well, I\\\\'d say that\\\\'s about him sticking to his routine. He knows what he should be doing at this time. He knows what he should be doing at that time. And then you ask him, \\\"Have you done this?\\\" \\\"Ohh, I\\\\'ve done it.\\\" But then you find out he hasn\\\\'t, okay. He has a call. He has a check-up call from the hospital while I\\\\'m at my job. And he\\\\'s not answering. He says, \\\"Oh, have you done this?\\\" and then says, \\\"Ohh, I don\\\\'t even know. I should have done that.\\\" You prepare. You want to eat this food and then make it, and then bring it, but he doesn\\\\'t want to eat it anymore. He wants to eat something else. A lot of those things come up. Those are just a few examples, and it\\\\'s very stressful and very annoying. That\\\\'s the fifth one, right? Yeah. Yeah, factors such as professional commitment and financial constraints, yes. Our professional commitment, definitely. There was a time I should have gone. You know, my company was planning to sponsor me on a trip to the United Kingdom for a seminar and some other fellowship, as well as some other knowledge and professional stuffs. It was meant to be a two-week trip. But I found a way to get someone to stay with him, and it all fell apart. I wasn\\\\'t able to go. It was really painful at that moment.', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] At that moment, I had to back out of the opportunity I had been waiting for all my life. It was frustrating and terrible. Well, yes, it is what it is. I have gotten something close, but it doesn't pin me down as much. And when I think of it, I'm supposed to do overtime sometimes just to get some extra cash, but I just can't. I have to dash out of the office on time because I have someone I'm caregiving for. I'm a caregiver, you know. It's really frustrating. And then you get home and meet other stresses and things. It's frustrating. So, professional commitments are a barrier for me, as far as I'm concerned, then financial constraints or health challenges. Well, financial constraints aren't really a problem for me at this moment. I'm above moderate and have a very good salary. My father, you know, he's worked things out for himself. So he has health insurance and other things covered by the job. So I don't really have to worry about financial stuff. It's all available. I wouldn't say financial constraints are a problem. Then there are health changes. Well, I sometimes fall sick and the sick person is still caring for a sick person. So I try my best not to fall sick.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] But when I do well, my wife actually takes the responsibility for doing what I\\\\'ve been doing. So I think that\\\\'s basically it. I get distracted. I get a lot of distraction, a lot, lots of distraction. You know, sometimes he just makes some emergency calls and then you pick up. \\\"What\\\\'s up?\\\" he says, and that would be really annoying. Like you call me five times and just want to hear my voice for what? And then I\\\\'m just, you know, I see your call. I\\\\'m panicking now. Maybe something is wrong and I just have to pick it up. You know, sometimes you see your call. Your brain says, \\\"I\\\\'m busy,\\\" or you just shoot them a text. \\\"I\\\\'m busy. I\\\\'ll call you later.\\\" And then that\\\\'s all.\\\\n\\\\nAnd when you\\\\'re done with your job, you call them. But you see the call. You know, it\\\\'s given for. So you just have to pick it up and then you say, \\\"Ohh, I just want to hear your voice.\\\" Why just want to do this and then you be like, \\\"Don\\\\'t call me.\\\" I have to pick up because of this and that. Don\\\\'t just call, because when I hear my voice, I\\\\'m busy at my job and with other things, and then he doesn\\\\'t hear and he keeps calling. So I get distracted a lot.\\\\n\\\\nBut it\\\\'s part of the job of caregiving, definitely. Well, yes, definitely. There are some positions we want to be promoted to, but it\\\\'s going to hit hard into the time of my caregiving. So I\\\\'ve declined a few of those offers.', \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] And then I hope it gets much, much better soon, so I can have fewer hours of care given, and perhaps take some professional promotions. No, I sleep well. I sleep well. He sleeps very well and wakes up early, so I have few issues. At night, I sleep well. For me, or for him? No, no, no, no, none of those.\\\\n\\\\nOkay. And do you sometimes feel concerned about what the future holds for you in this role? Yes, definitely. I definitely think about that. I've brought up that issue in family meetings and other discussions. So, no one is willing to take responsibility. Everyone's busy. Everyone is doing this and that, and it just feels like I have to keep doing this forever. I've declined many professional opportunities. I should have gotten promoted, which is costing me more money and other things. Then, this cake remains a barrier and other obstacles. Thinking about other things, I definitely have thoughts about what the future holds for me in this role. If it continues like this for a long time, I would have declined numerous offers and might still be in the same position for years. I'm hoping very soon that I'll have enough finances.\\\", \\\"\\\\n  [/INST] We can actually transfer him to a stable, professional home where we have professional caregivers and such. But our greatest hope is that his conditions improve, which would mean fewer hours of caregiving for us. And then, on the days we continue to be caregivers, we'll have fewer hours because he cannot do many things by himself. Doctors assure us that such a possibility is near in the future. We're also hoping that, if that doesn't work out, I won't be considering professional caregiving homes anymore. So that's it about that.\\\\n\\\\nThe truth is, if we could find someone to cover shifts when I'm active for two days a week and he's active for another two days, matching our schedules for another two days, or if I ask for 12 hours a day and he takes the other 12 hours, it would greatly ease my stress and burdens. And then, if we have enough finances, we could move him to a professional place \\u2013 the kind where they don't view it as a task but as their job, having been trained for it. They don't have anything else to stop them from doing their job. I believe those are the two best options.\\\\n\\\\nDefinitely, I think about that solution around 100% of the time.\\\", '\\\\n  [/INST] First of all, it\\\\'s financial basis, and then we\\\\'ve had a lot of stories about professional caregivers. You know, there have been instances of neglect and terrible happenings. That\\\\'s something he doesn\\\\'t want. He kicks against it. He doesn\\\\'t want it. We\\\\'ve brought up the idea in some meetings where the family is willing to donate and have that done. But he himself doesn\\\\'t want that. He says if we try that and he gets escaped from there, he\\\\'ll run off and do some of those things. You know, it\\\\'s really hard. He doesn\\\\'t want it. And we\\\\'re also concerned about the risk. That\\\\'s why we haven\\\\'t implemented it. He forgets a lot very frequently. Oh, no, he doesn\\\\'t forget me. He knows me, he knows me. But he mostly forgets other family members, not me, not me. And he doesn\\\\'t remember them. Yes, definitely. Like, \\\"What are you?\\\" \\\"What are you looking for?\\\" You know, sometimes it\\\\'s like, \\\"Oh, oh, John, I have a stranger in this house.\\\" It\\\\'s trying to come to the front door, doing this and that. You\\\\'ve had calls like that when my wife was back at her job, and he called me up. \\\"Oh John, I have this woman, a lady at my door. I don\\\\'t know what she\\\\'s looking for. Can you call the cops? Can you do this?\\\" And I\\\\'m like, \\\"It\\\\'s my wife for God\\\\'s sake.\\\" So you have issues like that, but he\\\\'s not aggressive towards them. He just wants to know who is who and what is what. And I\\\\'m sure he\\\\'s safe. I would say he\\\\'s progressing towards neutral.', '\\\\n  [/INST] \\\"Yeah. I don\\\\'t read it; I\\\\'ll read it. Well, I feel I might share my experiences, and I was thinking of possibly sharing some resources that can help me on my caregiving journey. Maybe we can discuss such things during the meeting.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n--End of Response--']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

anybody im not financially buoyant now yes i cant hear you fair enough im im fair enough fair enough health my isnt my home my mothers health my health at least im copying little i get tired stress is

remaining hours is for taking care of her no hes answer my mother im doing it because of my mother ill just make sure that i have given her her drugs her food then ill start working it has reduced my wages like like weeks ago now when i was working she she was awake what do i do ah i used to give her more than more than hours as key given do you sometimes feel concerned about what future holds for

had to attend to her before going she can remember me i show her some old videos of ours some pictures lots more she she react amazingly she goes into her room when someone comes in as in she as she reacts amazingly sometimes not every time no no not him stressful\",\n          \"my name is john smith i am years old i am child to you know person with dementia is my father ok im only one who is major caregiver ok answering question one well for past few weeks yeah its about years to years hes why so weak so before going to my job i ensure hes fine i provide every basic things he needs you know he slowed his his emails his phone calls voicemails he has sure everything are kept in check sure hes using his medication they are all set before i go to my job at my job i always calling i calling at least twice to check on him to make sure hes doing fine make sure hes not having any reaction side effects to medication make sure hes resting one is supposed to make sure hes doing little exercise that has been prepared for him you know when im back also i take him we go for walk take stroll around we do little exercise sometimes we go to church together there sure he also eats well eat fruits eats necessary things those use medication those little exercise then also on days of his visit to hospital so its just like normal thing you do for your child i immediately im responsible for most of things ok someone says that ok well for past few weeks i would say pressure is much more lesser than before then i had you know when we first started it was lot for me to taking balancing being caregiver also having full time job its really really tough its really tough then being at entry level someone with little i have buses which im also under their command you know its really hard to have my wish in time like that so then also its its always very difficult coping with new development you know things your father can do before easily before you find it you say that hes having hard time doing them you always just have to be around ensuring that it does it right so its always very tough to take in its really hard to believe that this is happening so for for past few weeks ice after that im finding it little bit more easier because ive let it become part of me ive let it become something i do you know i would im willing to go extra mile to make sure theyre ok theyre fine because theyve also sacrificed lot for me so for past few weeks i have made it my habits you know something i do without being for something i do without seeing it thats hard job though theres lot of challenge definitely lot of challenge tell him something he forgets it easily has few reactions some things you did yesterday you can remember some things you know lot of things lot of challenges but ive learned to just calm down you know sometimes when its overwhelming i just take walk just listen to music just do something to calm me myself down because i cannot be transferring aggression to him i cannot show any sign of no anger any other things because it would really really affect his own wellbeing so i rather would rather take walk on his throat rather just turn my earbuds on listen to loud music just do something to just chill off before i can actually think on what next to do so i would say im really coping nicely im finding strategies to make it much more easier for me so thats how that is ok well relationship with friends family colleagues definitely there is shift i spend more time at home apart from my job apart from my job you know most times then i would love to socialize you know visit friends go to watch game go to at club go to lottery houses you know i spent my most of my free times there my weekends you know im socializing im hanging out im doing lot of stuff sports now i have to spend there with my parents my dad because he needs care everything is getting better though but he needs care so thats affected my relationship with my friends well it makes me my wife have much more time together since im spending more time at home with my father shes always around too so but with my friends thats really severed relationship we do lot of call video calls you know voice calls to kind of compensate for may not being able to show up there sometimes that some occasions will clash with days he has to go to hospital so its really done little to that my friends my colleagues you know my colleague maybe having birthday celebration at his home hes having occasion its classes with sometime by time i have to just be with my dad so most of them do actually understand they understand my situation they dont get annoyed so we go to watch some basketball sometimes makes him more happy makes him lively you know you see him celebrate him when he sees says he hook he goes cold some other things makes him more lively you know it adds makes health better some other things so thats pretty much how when i go out then relationship with my friends colleagues it has done little damage to it definitely i it has it is about where its stopping me from going out its making me spend more time at home spend more time with my dad just ensuring that things are going as it should but i dont see that as you know when you people say barrier you know its something very negative something terrible something you dont want to but it is what it is now im not seeing it as barrier im just saying that is that how can i describe it as alternative you know im learning new way of life instead of being that you know extroverts talk so much going out partying having so much fun spending money wasting money wasting time doing some other things i now taking all those energies transfer it into something useful apart from while im even caregiving i have some remote things i do i trade crypto i do some other things so i want to say its barrier anymore it has taught me how to actually invest in myself do things while im at home so that also helped me in way ok well in my decision making process i think no real change no real change no real change any decision i need to make you know in regards to him sometimes he actually is able to make few decisions sometimes you know explaining some things to him he doesnt understand we write it down let him greet we play it let him listen to it very slowly then if he understands he can make some decisions he makes about of decisions i make about so in regards to him i dont think there is any change in my decision making process then its more than fine i think twice before i make any decisions i compare my alternatives i consider lot of choices before i can actually make decision but as regards myself well some decisions i make as regards my own life i shared this with my wife theres no real need of sharing with my dad because even if i shared with him before tomorrow he forgets something like that so my decisions as regards myself my family i dont really share them with him because he dont really are remembers most of those things few ones that actually you know but you know real issues as regarding my decision making process i dont share that with him there is no change you know when you say change in decision making process maybe because im frustrated i make certain decisions because im angry i make certain decisions ive taught myself so much to be able to control all those calm myself down take it through listen to good music do something that just you know its little stressful now then when im come when im settled i can now think my way out of making very good decision because when you make decisions when you are annoyed most times it is end of time there are no good decisions because at that point i wont say youve lost your mind but you are totally out of yourself such situation might be really really terrible have nasty consequences so ive taught myself how to control them yeah that that is definitely true thats definitely true caregiving it sure it doesnt clash with you stuffs especially critical visits to hospitals so i make sure any vacation something doesnt tamper with that well about location i have home here so i dont see any circumstance of me you know moving out of this area for at least for next years so but if there would be maybe case maybe any circumstance that would actually need relocation movement i think there even would definitely be barrier because we have to actually transfer hospitals then get stable around place where we are feed them with all previous information they need to know then continue doing it there because it definitely is factor i would consider before i make such kinds of huge decisions you know decisions that would really affect him like me going on vacation locating going for holidays somewhere something it is major function that i have to consider ok now commitment page yeah definitely professional commitment yes eversource yeah self keep practicing yeah manage daily stress describe yourself here properties past weeks might stress of caregiving share strategies ok well selfcare practices like i said sometimes it gets very frustrating you know sometimes some things you tell him you forget its really annoying because sometimes its annoying definitely any normal person will get annoyed with some things like i said in previous recordings i have taught myself to manage these stresses it wasnt days job two years job three years job its been over years now so i go for walk when im having when im feeling stress you know having gone to my full time job makes lot of difficulties stuffs problems every other thing im coming back then i just want peace then im still having lot of things to deal with you know frustration sets in terrible mood swings anger every other thing so i learned to take walk you know once its not that its in critical situation where i need to be there i will just take walk i just go to my music room put on my earbuds listen to music play piano do something that would ease my stress i just even go to sitting room just watch netflix just laugh laugh out sometimes then is stress away so some of strategies have actually been employing sure i go away from that then sometimes i just you know i just try to cope with it i makes decisions not to get annoyed you know some things are supposed to make you annoyed then to see why am i why am i why am i even getting annoyed for no reason listen isnt something much that should get me annoyed then i just flush out thought of being annoyed then take it as something normal so i think those are some of major strategies i have employed as regards coping with daily stresses every other stuff how frequently ill say ill say majorly five days week five days i got my job definitely very stressful i dont even know that i should have done that then you prepare you want to eat this food then you make it then you bring it he doesnt want to eat it anymore he wants to eat something else you know lot of those things come up those are just few of examples its very stressful very annoying thats fifth one yeah factors such as professional commitment financial constraints yes our professional commitment definitely you know there was time i should you know have i my company was planning to actually sponsor me on trip to i think to united kingdom you know for seminar some other fellowship then for some other knowledge professional stuffs it was meant to be two weeks then i found way to get someone to stay with him every other thing it just fell apart i wasnt able to go it was really painful at that moment at that moment i you know just had to back out of opportunity that i had been waiting all my life for then it was frustrating terrible yeah it is what it is i have gotten something close that now so it doesnt pin me so much when i think of it so lot of professional commitments you know sometimes i am supposed to do over some over time just to get some extra cash then i just cant i just have to be dashing out of office money time because i have someone im caregiving you know its really really frustrating then you get home you meet some other stress some other things frustrating so i would say professional commitment care given standards barrier between lot of professional commitments as far as im concerned then financial constraints health challenges well financial constraints for me at this moment im im above moderate in very good salary my father also you know hes worked some things down for himself so he has his health insurance some other things that basically covered by job things he has done while he was still active so i dont really have support care about financial stuff it is well available so i wont say financial constraints is really any problem then health changes well sometimes i also fall sick then sick person still caring for sick person so i try my as best as much as i as i can not to fall sick i get distracted get lot of distraction lot lots of distraction you know sometimes he just makes some emergency call then you pick up you be like whats up says i just want to hear your voice you know that would be really annoying like you call me five times just want to hear my voice for what then im just you know i see your call im panicking now maybe something is wrong i just have to pick it up you know sometimes you see your call you know my brain say oh im busy you just shoot them text im busy ill call you later then thats all when you are done with job you call them but you see call you know it you know is someone ok given for so you just have to pick it up then you say ohh im busy at my job some other things then he doesnt hear he keeps calling so i get distracted lot yes definitely there are some positions i want us to be promoted to but its going to definitely hit hit into time of my care given so ive declined few of those offers then i hope it gets very very much more better soon then i can have less hours care given then maybe take some professional you know promotions no i sleep well i sleep well eat good he sleeps very he sleeps very early he wakes up late no no none of those ok do you sometimes feel concerned about what future holds for you in room definitely i definitely think about that i definitely think about that ive table that you know in family meetings some other stuff so you know no one is willing to take responsibility everyones busy everyone is doing this that it just feels like i just have to keep doing this forever then i think that well ive actually declined lot of professional things i should have you know gotten promoted getting costing me more money getting me you know some other things then this cake even is staying as barrier some other things you know just thinking about some other things so i definitely have thoughts most of time what future holds for me in this role because if it continues like this for long time you know i would have to decline lot of offers along line i might still be in same position for years so i consider that then im hoping very soon that one actually have enough finances we can actually transfer him to stable you know professional home where we have professional caregivers stuff like that but utmost prayer is that his conditions improve then we actually have less hours of caregiving then we are still caregivers that day but we have less hours because he cannot do many things by himself well doctors are promised that that is possibility in nearest future we are also hoping that god if that is possible but if that doesnt work out then at some point i wont be considering i would be considering professional caregiving homes so i guess thats it about that well truth is if i have someone someone else if we can run something like shift when im active for these two days week then hes active for another two days match for another two days im asking for hours day then he takes other hours you know something like that it would ease me of lot of stress lot of burdens then if possibly if we have enough finances we can just move him to professional place you know those ones they dont see it as task theyve been trained for that then they do it to any living so thats their job they dont have something else to stop in them so i think those might be two great options definitely definitely i think about that by percent of time first of all its financial basis then also weve had lot of stories about professional caregivers you know neglect terrible happenings that weve had that doesnt want he weve actually brought up in some meetings where family is willing to donate then get that done but he himself doesnt want that he says if we try that he gets escaped from there hes gonna run

ca nt hear you no nobody either its to go out i do nt used to leave her at home go out i go with i go out with her ill put her inside car go out nobody to stay with her in past few weeks of earning factors such as professional commitment financial constraints for health challenges influence how you fees based on this these special therapists are attention caregiver used to allow her to allow

this has affected me in lot of ways what do i do ah i used to give her more than more than hours as key given do you sometimes feel concerned about what future holds for you in that room if so could you share more about it what kind of help support will bear for you economist question as caregiver do you sometimes feel concerned about future what future holds for you in that if so yes yes yes

room when someone comes in as in she as she reacts amazingly sometimes not every time no no no she does nt no she remembers me no no no i do nt used to allow her to go outside alone two times in week no no not him stressful\",\n          \"ok my name is yeah my name is john smith i am years old i am child to you know person with dementia is my father ok i m only one who is major caregiver ok answering question one well for past few weeks yeah its about years to years he s why so weak yeah i m i m always with him he stays with me we stay together so before going to my job i ensure he s fine i provide every basic things he needs you know he slowed his his emails his phone calls voicemails he has sure everything are kept in check sure he s using his medication they are all set before i go to my job at my job i always calling i calling at least twice to check on him to make sure he s doing fine make sure he s not having any reaction side effects to medication make sure he s resting one is supposed to make sure he s doing little exercise that has been prepared for him you know when i m back also i take him we go for walk take stroll around we do little exercise sometimes we go to church together there sure he also eats well eat fruits eats necessary things those use medication those little exercise then also on days of his visit to hospital sure i take him there on time i m always saying while he s in doctor we are done you know come back home so its just like normal thing you do for your child so it i immediately i m responsible for most of things ok someone says that ok well for past few weeks i would say pressure is much more lesser than before then i had you know when we first started it was lot for me to taking balancing being caregiver also having full time job its really really tough its really tough then being at entry level someone with little no you know superiority i have buses which i m also under their command you know its really hard to have my wish in time like that so then also its its always very difficult coping with new development you know things your father can do before easily before you find it you say that he s having hard time doing them you always just have to be around ensuring that it does it right so its always very tough to take in its really hard to believe that this is happening so for for past few weeks ice after that i m finding it little bit more easier because i ve let it become part of me i ve let it become something i do you know not because i want to receive award for some you know some people work because they just want to get pay some people do some things because they just want to you know receive profits from it but when you do something because of all of you have for person you do nt count it as something that even if its not reciprocated well you do nt see it as anything so i ve learned to teach myself to do it because i love my father my parents i would i m willing to go extra mile to make sure they re ok they re fine because they ve also sacrificed lot for me so for past few weeks i have made it my habits you know something i do without being for something i do without seeing it that s hard job though there s lot of challenge definitely lot of challenge tell him something he forgets it easily has few reactions some things you did yesterday you can remember some things you know lot of things lot of challenges but i ve learned to just calm down you know sometimes when its overwhelming i just take walk just listen to music just do something to calm me myself down because i can not be transferring aggression to him i can not show any sign of no anger any other things because it would really really affect his own wellbeing so i rather would rather take walk on his throat rather just turn my earbuds on listen to loud music just do something to just chill off before i can actually think on what next to do so i would say i m really coping nicely i m finding strategies to make it much more easier for me so that s how that is ok well relationship with friends family colleagues definitely there is shift i spend more time at home apart from my job apart from my job you know most times then i would love to socialize you know visit friends go to watch game go to at club go to lottery houses you know i spent my most of my free times there my weekends you know i m socializing i m hanging out i m doing lot of stuff sports now i have to spend there with my parents my dad because he needs care everything is getting better though but he needs care so that s affected my relationship with my friends well it makes me my wife have much more time together since i m spending more time at home with my father she s always around too so but with my friends that s really severed relationship we do lot of call video calls you know voice calls to kind of compensate for may not being able to show up there sometimes that some occasions will clash with days he has to go to hospital i just have to cancel occasion you know so its really done little to that my friends my colleagues you know my colleague maybe having birthday celebration at his home he s having occasion its classes with sometime by time i have to just be with my dad so most of them do actually understand they understand my situation they do nt get annoyed but definitely i would say it has really affected it has made me more introvert no staying indoors just loving things i can do indoors you know i only go out when i have to apart from my job sometimes i take my dad also sees to see game because he loves basketball so we go to watch some basketball sometimes makes him more happy makes him lively you know you see him celebrate him when he sees says he hook he goes cold some other things makes him more lively you know it adds makes health better some other things so that s pretty much how when i go out then relationship with my friends colleagues it has done little damage to it definitely definitely it is it is i it has it is about where its stopping me from going out its making me spend more time at home spend more time with my dad just ensuring that things are going as it should so but i do nt see that as you know when you people say barrier you know its something very negative something terrible something you do nt want to but it is what it is now i m not seeing it as barrier i m just saying that is that how can i describe it as alternative you know i m learning new way of life instead of being that you know extroverts talk so much going out partying having so much fun spending money wasting money wasting time doing some other things i now taking all those energies transfer it into something useful apart from while i m even caregiving i have some remote things i do i trade crypto i do some other things so i want to say its barrier anymore it has taught me how to actually invest in myself do things while i m at home so that also helped me in way ok well in my decision making process i think no real change no real change no real change any decision i need to make you know in regards to him sometimes he actually is able to make few decisions sometimes you know explaining some things to him he does nt understand we write it down let him greet we play it let him listen to it very slowly then if he understands he can make some decisions he makes about of decisions i make about so in regards to him i do nt think there is any change in my decision making process then its more than fine i think twice before i make any decisions i compare my alternatives i consider lot of choices before i can actually make decision but as regards myself well some decisions i make as regards my own life i shared this with my wife there s no real need of sharing with my dad because even if i shared with him before tomorrow he forgets something like that so my decisions as regards myself my family i do nt really share them with him because he do nt really are remembers most of those things few ones that actually you know like maybe ah ohh its your granddaughter birthday its your grandsons birthday something like that ohh its your its your wifes birthday its my birthday you know things like that that they re just for moment so we share those with him but you know real issues as regarding my decision making process i do nt share that with him there is no change you know when you say change in decision making process maybe because i m frustrated i make certain decisions because i m angry i make certain decisions i ve taught myself so much to be able to control all those calm myself down take it through listen to good music do something that just you know its little stressful now then when i m come when i m settled i can now think my way out of making very good decision because when you make decisions when you are annoyed most times it is end of time there are no good decisions because at that point i wo nt say you ve lost your mind but you are totally out of yourself such situation might be really really terrible have nasty consequences so i ve taught myself how to control them yeah that that is definitely true that s definitely true caregiving yes definitely it does affect it affects those decisions you know i before i go for any vacation of stuff i have to plan it very well it sure it does nt clash with you stuffs especially critical visits to hospitals so i make sure any vacation something does nt tamper with that well about location i have home here so i do nt see any circumstance of me you know moving out of this area for at least for next years so i love this place i settled in i think i m doing fine so but if there would be maybe case maybe any circumstance that would actually need relocation movement i think there even would definitely be barrier because we have to actually transfer hospitals then get stable around place where we are feed them with all previous information they need to know then continue doing it there because it definitely is factor i would consider before i make such kinds of huge decisions you know decisions that would really affect him like me going on vacation locating going for holidays somewhere something it is major function that i have to consider ok now commitment page yeah definitely professional commitment yes eversource definitely they have affected some things with us ok yeah self keep practicing yeah manage daily stress describe yourself here properties past weeks might stress of caregiving share strategies ok well selfcare practices like i said sometimes it gets very frustrating you know sometimes some things you tell him you forget its really annoying because sometimes its annoying definitely any normal person will get annoyed with some things like i said in previous recordings i have taught myself to manage these stresses it was nt days job two years job three years job its been over years now so i go for walk when i m having when i m feeling stress you know having gone to my full time job makes lot of difficulties stuffs problems every other thing i m coming back then i just want peace then i m still having lot of things to deal with you know frustration sets in terrible mood swings anger every other thing so i learned to take walk you know once its not that its in critical situation where i need to be there i will just take walk i just go to my music room put on my earbuds listen to music play piano do something that would ease my stress i just even go to sitting room just watch netflix just laugh laugh out sometimes then is stress away so some of strategies have actually been employing sure i go away from that you know i i go away from where he is just try to ease with stress then then sometimes then sometimes i just you know i just try to cope with it i makes decisions not to get annoyed you know some things are supposed to make you annoyed then to see why am i why am i why am i even getting annoyed for no reason listen is nt something much that should get me annoyed then i just flush out thought of being annoyed then take it as something normal so i think those are some of major strategies i have employed as regards coping with daily stresses every other stuff how frequently ill say ill say majorly five days week five days i got my job definitely very stressful well i would say is about him keeping to his routine he knows what he should be doing at this time he knows what he should be doing at that time then you ask him have you done this ohh i ve done it then you find out he s not done it ok he has call he has check up call from hospital while i m at my job he s not he s not picking them up he s not answering he say oh have you done this say ohh i do nt even know that i should have done that then you prepare you want to eat this food then you make it then you bring it he does nt want to eat it anymore he wants to eat something else you know lot of those things come up those are just few of examples its very stressful very annoying that s fifth one right yeah yeah factors such as professional commitment financial constraints yes our professional commitment definitely you know there was time i should you know have i my company was planning to actually sponsor me on trip to i think to united kingdom you know for seminar some other fellowship then for some other knowledge professional stuffs it was meant to be two weeks then i found way to get someone to stay with him every other thing it just fell apart i was nt able to go it was really painful at that moment at that moment i you know just had to back out of opportunity that i had been waiting all my life for then it was frustrating terrible well yeah it is what it is i have gotten something close that now so it does nt pin me so much when i think of it so lot of professional commitments you know sometimes i am supposed to do over some over time just to get some extra cash then i just ca nt i just have to be dashing out of office money time because i have someone i m caregiving you know its really really frustrating then you get home you meet some other stress some other things frustrating so i would say professional commitment care given standards barrier between lot of professional commitments as far as i m concerned then financial constraints health challenges well financial constraints for me at this moment well i thank god i think i m i m i m above moderate in very good salary my father also you know he s worked some things down for himself so he has his health insurance some other things that basically covered by job things he has done while he was still active so i do nt really have support care about financial stuff it is well available so i wo nt say financial constraints is really any problem then health changes well sometimes i also fall sick then sick person still caring for sick person so i try my as best as much as i as i can not to fall sick but when i do i well my wife actually takes takes responsibility of doing what i ve been doing so i think that s basically it i get distracted get lot of distraction lot lots of distraction you know sometimes he just makes some emergency call then you pick up you be like what s up says i just want to hear your voice you know that would be really annoying like you call me five times just want to hear my voice for what then i m just you know i see your call i m panicking now maybe something is wrong i just have to pick it up you know sometimes you see your call you know my brain say oh i m busy you just shoot them text i m busy ill call you later then that s all when you are done with job you call them but you see call you know it you know is someone ok given for so you just have to pick it up then you say ohh i just want to hear your voice why just want to do this then you be like do nt call me like this when i see your call i have to pick up because of this that do nt just call because when i hear my voice i m busy at my job some other things then he does nt hear he keeps calling so i get distracted lot so but its part of job of caregiving definitely well yes definitely there are some positions i want us to be promoted to but its going to definitely hit hit into time of my care given so i ve declined few of those offers then i hope it gets very very much more better soon then i can have less hours care given then maybe take some professional you know promotions no i sleep well i sleep well eat good he sleeps very he sleeps very early he wakes up late so i hardly have any issues at night i sleep well for me for him no no no no none of those ok do you sometimes feel concerned about what future holds for you in room yeah definitely i definitely think about that i definitely think about that i ve table that you know in family meetings some other stuff so you know no one is willing to take responsibility everyones busy everyone is doing this that it just feels like i just have to keep doing this forever then i think that well i ve actually declined lot of professional things i should have you know gotten promoted getting costing me more money getting me you know some other things then this cake even is staying as barrier some other things you know just thinking about some other things so i definitely have thoughts most of time what future holds for me in this role because if it continues like this for long time you know i would have to decline lot of offers along line i might still be in same position for years so i consider that then i m hoping very soon that one actually have enough finances we can actually transfer him to stable you know professional home where we have professional caregivers stuff like that but utmost prayer is that his conditions improve then we actually have less hours of caregiving then we are still caregivers that day but we have less hours because he can not do many things by himself well doctors are promised that that is possibility in nearest future we are also hoping that god if that is possible but if that does nt work out then at some point i wo nt be considering i would be considering professional caregiving homes so i guess that s it about that well truth is if i have someone someone else if we can run something like shift when i m active for these two days week then he s active for another two days match for another two days i m asking for hours day then he takes other hours you know something like that it would ease me of lot of stress lot of burdens then if possibly if we have enough finances we can just move him to professional place you know those ones they do nt see it as task they ve been trained for that then they do it to any living so that s their job they do nt have something else to stop in them so i think those might be two great options ok yeah definitely definitely i think about that by percent of time first of all its financial basis then also we ve had lot of stories about professional caregivers you know neglect terrible happenings that we ve had that does nt want he he he kicks he kicks against it he does nt want it we ve actually brought up in some meetings where family is willing to donate then get that done but he himself does nt want that he says if we try that he gets escaped from there he s gon na run off do some of that stuffs you know its really hard he does nt want it then we also we are concerned about risk so that s why were not really implemented he forgets lot very frequently ohh me no he does nt forget me he does nt forget me he knows me he knows me mostly forget some other family members but not not me not me does nt remember them yeah definitely like oh what are you what are you looking for you know sometimes like oh oh john i have stranger in this house its trying to come to front door doing this that you know i ve had calls like that when my wife you know my wife was back at her job then he called me up ohh john i have this woman lady at my door i do nt know what she s looking for can you call cops can you do this i m like its my wife for gods sake so you have issues like that so but he s not aggressive towards them he just wants to know who is who what is what i m sure he s safe i would say progressive out to neutral yeah so i do nt read it read it well i feel i might share my experiences then i was thinking maybe there are some resources that can actually help me caregiving journey maybe something like that would also be shared during meeting so those are things i m looking for\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\":
